00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:14.480
Wonton!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.400
Father.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.080
Freshly steamed buns!

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.600
Buns!

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.360
Your wonton is here.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.240
Sir,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.440
where are they all going?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.320
Looking for work.

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:31.280
That Governor-General
surrounded the Lu family.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.520
Most businesses have shut down.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.376
No money to be made.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.720
So everyone's trying
to find other ways to earn.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.000
Is that your son?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.520
Only 16.

00:00:43.584 --> 00:00:46.016
He's a responsible kid.
He wants to help support the family.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.920
What's going on?

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.040
Aren't they done yet?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.280
Boss, they can't get it out.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.280
Boss,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.280
the pearls we swallowed are too big.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.480
Just wait a bit longer.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.480
We're experienced.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.000
We won't delay your business.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
Dawn's approaching.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.560
The situation's tense lately.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.800
We can't wait any longer.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.040
Understood.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.360
Boss.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.440
Jia,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.000
your brother died for me.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.560
This compensation is for your family.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.920
It was an honor
for my brother to die for you.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.360
Good.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
Inform the Old Master.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040
The Lusong merchants

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.320
have already prepaid for those pearls.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.400
I've had his share of tribute

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.760
deposited into Tianfu Bank.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.720
Here are two premium pearls.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.440
One for the Old Master.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.760
Another for his advisor.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880
The Old Master said

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.000
now that Ningzhou is in such turmoil,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.960
he'll have better leverage
to mediate at court.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.160
You needn't worry excessively.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.840
It won't be long

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.120
before this is resolved.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.760
Okay.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.080
Thank you.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.080
Go on.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.080

00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:39.232
He was found hanged
across the street this morning.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.120
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.400
My lord,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.320
both corpses have been examined.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440
No signs of poisoning.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.840
It seems voluntary.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.800
Three deaths in four days.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.760
How could this be voluntary?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.760
If this stirs public outrage

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.960
and reaches the court,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.320
the consequences will be severe.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.680
I've stationed men
along the postal routes.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.560
But we didn't find the decree bearer.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.120
What's really going on here?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.000
My lord,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.720
what should we do?

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.600
Stay calm. If you lose composure,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.160
others will follow suit.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.960
My lord, Madam Lu wants to see you.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.640
The inevitable has arrived.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.960
My lord, please take a seat.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.000
My lord,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.480
these are provisions sent by the people.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.520
I'm sharing some with you.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.200
Three lives lost,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.840
yet you appear completely unfazed.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.320
Don't care about it?

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.080
What else can I do?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.120
This is the people's will.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.800
You should reflect on your actions.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.320
Are you threatening me with human lives?

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.760
I wouldn't dare.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.880
You wouldn't dare?

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.600
Harboring pirates, smuggling pearls
in human bodies,

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.440
and trampling on human life.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.040
What wouldn't you dare to do?

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.120
These accusations
require solid evidence, my lord.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.760
Without evidence, it's just slander.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.840
Jin was poisoned.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.160
Shi'an's mother was poisoned
before her death.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.360
And the deaths of those three civilians.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.800
Madam, are you stalling for time?

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.800
Waiting for your protectors
in the imperial court to intervene?

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.560
My lord, it's better to resolve grudges
than create new ones.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.600
Even if you eliminate the Lu family,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.040
another family will rise.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.440
The art of governance

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.240
lies in adaptability.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.280
Why make unnecessary enemies?

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.880
I never expected as a merchant,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.400
you understand politics so well.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
Of course.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.480
You're still young, my lord.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.480
You should always consider
the consequences of your actions.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.200
Don't paint yourself into a dead end.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.520
Madam,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.640
don't think you can deceive His Majesty
just because you have protectors.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.640
The Inner Bureau exists
to uphold law and purge corruption.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.480
A dead end can sometimes
lead to survival.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.640
We'll see about that.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.960
I'll see myself out.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.680
Wait here. I'll get medicine for you.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.000
What are you doing?

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.080
L-Lord Shen.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.720
As a father,

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.440
I just want to see my ailing daughter.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.640
To see her? Or harm her?

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.000
Lu Shi'an,

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.000
you came to kill Jin, didn't you?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.160
I didn't.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.480
That medicine wouldn't harm her.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.680
You're finally telling the truth?

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.080
The medicine's wearing off.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.040
So you want to administer another?

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:18.920
I didn't.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.040
Shen Que,

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.520
don't talk nonsense without evidence.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.320
Evidence?

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.360
The evidence's right on you.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.000
Gao Fu.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:27.360
Yes.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.880
Take him.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:28.320
Understood.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.240
Go.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.640
Go.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.200
My lord, nothing's there.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.560
Go on stripping.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.680
Take it off.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.920
Go on!

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.120
What are you doing?

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.920
A'man, you'll understand soon.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.080
Stay out of this, A'man.

00:09:26.016 --> 00:09:27.168
I'm part of the Lu family.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.800
Lord Shen's suspicion is justified.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.760
You're still acting now?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:33.400
Gao Fu.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:33.880
Yes.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.680
Help him.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.240
Understood.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.800
No need.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.040
Take it off.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.720
I'll do it myself.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.720
Boots.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.120
Found it, my lord.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.320
The poison in Jin's body?

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.200
Lu Shi'an,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.960
how could it be you?

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.480
A'man, do you believe I'd harm Jin?

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.520
I thought you were simply cowardly,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.480
always prioritizing self-preservation.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.000
But as a man and father...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.320
Yes.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.200
Jin is your...

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.360
I'm cowardly and selfish,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.720
but this time, I just wanted
to save my daughter.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.720
A'man, this is the antidote,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.640
not poison.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.400
I stole it from my grandmother.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.360
My lord, it's non-toxic.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.480
But whether it's the antidote

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.720
requires testing.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.600
Mother.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.640
Jin's awake.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.080
See, A'man? I didn't lie.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.360
Dad. Father.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.320
If you wish to see Jin in the future,

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.760
just tell Gao Fu.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.280
No need.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.760
My lord,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.120
after Jin recovers,

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.720
please send her out of Ningzhou.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.640
After all this time,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.040
I've come to realize

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.800
that your care for Jin is genuine.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.640
Ningzhou's turmoil
hasn't reached its peak yet.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.920
Send her somewhere you can protect her.

No. You were just overprotective
out of care.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.080
You noticed?

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.760

he didn't give Gao Fu the antidote.

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.440
Instead, he sneaked into Jin's chamber
