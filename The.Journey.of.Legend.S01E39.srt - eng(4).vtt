00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.310
Master.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.120
The Chief is back.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.030
How is he?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.140
The Chief is...

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.520
He is...

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.430
Master.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.480
Shirong.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.610
The Chief is...

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.700
Notify the elders of the gang—

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:32.630
in 3 days,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.260
we'll hold a river burial.

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.360
Keep his death a secret from outsiders.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.620
Just say that Chenzhou

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.780
has gone to distant mountains for cultivation.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.270
I must... avenge the Chief.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.920
After this, there's still something else I need you to do.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.050
Someone will surely

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.510
come to cause trouble at the mourning hall.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:02.710
You must be prepared.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.560
We must ensure Chenzhou's final journey

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.510
is peaceful.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.120
Yes.

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.070
Before entering the capital...

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.360
Chenzhou must have foreseen that this day would come.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.390
I just...

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.690
found a secret letter he left behind.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.240
It says

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.380
if anything happens to him...

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.950
place this object with him in the coffin.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.800
The tiger tally?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.640
Li Chenzhou died suddenly from poisoning.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.330
They will hold a river burial for him in 3 days.

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.630
Zhao Shirong

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.310
actually wants to bury

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.510
the tiger tally with him in the coffin.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.120
They're keeping his death a secret,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.180
claiming that he's cultivating in distant mountains.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.190
Li Chenzhou

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.970
had truly overestimated himself.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.920
Knowing full well that his very identity

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.720
was something the court feared,

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.120
he still tried to

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.710
persuade His Majesty

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.720
to abandon peace talks with the Northern Wasteland.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.320
In the martial world as well,

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.810
he spared no effort

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.580
opposing me at every turn.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.750
He brought this fate upon himself.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:50.750
It seems I must

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.360
pay proper respects at his mourning hall.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.510
Those from the Power Gang have always been treacherous.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.110
We should still be cautious.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.360
Li Chenzhou was given poisoned wine some time ago.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.360
By now, he should be dead.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.120
Besides, this news

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.010
came from that person within their gang.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.430
His information has never been wrong.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.320
If he's truly dead, that's for the best.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.480
If he's only faking it, so be it.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.310
It's just that at a time like this...

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.520
we need to seize the tiger tally.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.530
-Chief.
-Chief.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.440
-May you rest in peace.
-May you rest in peace.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.390
Suifeng.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.480
Close the coffin.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.000
Suifeng.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:15.630
Blade King.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.730
Follow me to the riverside for burial.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.200
Yes.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.320
Shirong,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.510
we haven't paid our respects yet.

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.960
Why the rush to bury him?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.770
Fang, you're here too.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.510
Instead of returning to the Tang Sect to mourn Old Madam Tang,

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.710
why are you here mourning someone else?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.840
You really came.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.510
Finally, you've all been lured out.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.120
Water King.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.790
Human King.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.240
The Chief showed you nothing but kindness.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.060
Even you have betrayed us.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.960
I've been lurking in the martial world for years,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.030
gathering intelligence

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.960
and passing secret messages—

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.290
I've never failed once.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.000
Once I learned that Li Chenzhou had been fatally poisoned

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.200
beyond medical help,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.360
I knew the Power Gang's days were numbered.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.910
Today's letter regarding his funeral

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.240
was my way, along with my subordinates,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.440
of pledging allegiance to Xiao Kaiyan.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.670
Fine.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.720
And what's your reason?

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:14.730
We've never gotten along.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.410
I wanted to rebel when the Sword King died.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.390
Now that Li Chenzhou is dead,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.720
you, Liu Suifeng, are in charge.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.150
There's no place left for me.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.150
You two shameless traitors.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:27.840
The blades I've been saving for you both

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.240
will be used on you today.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480
Nangong Wushang,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.360
even your Nangong family

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.630
is willing to serve Xiao Kaiyan now?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.580
The Power Gang is falling.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.060
What can a few of you

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.410
possibly accomplish?

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:45.960
I'll seize the tiger tally now

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:47.780
and claim the first merit!

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.910
Shirong,

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.290
protect the coffin from them.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.700
I'll take care of these traitors.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.080
Tang Qing...

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:45.270
I knew you never took me seriously.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.670
But I never thought

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.560
you would side with the enemy

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.800
to overthrow our Tang Sect.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.850
Now that it's come to this,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.810
do you have any regrets?

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.730
Of course, I have regrets.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.790
I regret losing to you at every turn.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.770
Everyone has jealousy

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.510
in their hearts.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.120
But your mistake

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.720
was letting your jealousy control you

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.200
and letting others

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720
use you as their weapon.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.150
Father,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.510
I have avenged you.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.510
Li Chenzhou.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.680
I don't care if you're really dead or just pretending.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.070
Killing you again

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.420
would be no trouble at all.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.350
Chief!

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.590
Chenzhou!

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.830
Well played, Li Chenzhou.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.130
Poison couldn't finish you...

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.040
Then I'll just kill you myself.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:02.070
Master!

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.720
Master...

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:34.110
You went to great lengths to lure me here,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.640
only to end up like this,

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.310
yet you haven't left a scratch on me.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.750
Li Chenzhou!

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:47.720
Thank you.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.720
Master!

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.880
Master!

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.110
Feng.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.510
Chief, as long as you're fine,

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.880
I can rest easy.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.310
Master.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.310
This matter was of great importance,

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.960
so we concealed the feigned death plan from you all.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.290
The original plan was to

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.340
root out the traitors in our gang,

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.990
but we didn't expect you to be severely injured, Suifeng.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.310
Master.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.200
Fang...

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.220
You're hot-tempered.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.440
As your brother, I'm very worried.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.880
I hope you'll think carefully before acting in the future.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.200
Don't be reckless.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.270
Master.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.960
Feng.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:12.680
Master!

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.100
Blade King.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.490
Yes, Chief.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.830
Take Suifeng to my study.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.440
In the hidden compartment under the desk,

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.030
there's an Azure Heaven Elixir

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.430
that might save his life.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.310
Chenzhou.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.510
Yes.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.270
The rest

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.730
depends on his own fortune.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:52.680
Chief.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.590
I have a request.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:59.400
Go ahead.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:04.080
I only wish to stay by Master's side from now on.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.930
To share his fate, whatever comes.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:20.350
As you wish.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.070
Thank you, Chief.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.310
Master.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.000
Master.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:56.920
Chenzhou,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.720
the poison in your body hasn't been fully neutralized.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.380
You must not use all your internal energy again.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.030
After we rescue General Wu,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.790
let the Herbal King treat you properly.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.440
Rong.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.170
The world is...

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:18.480
beyond saving now.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.090
If General Wu truly dies at the hands of those traitors—

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.790
once the news spreads

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.100
and stirs public outrage—

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.160
uniting our collective will

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.800
to strike against foreign enemies might be the best choice now.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.440
Why the sudden change?

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.740
Now that the traitors in our gang have been eliminated,

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.290
we might have a chance to save General Wu.

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:56.310
My mind is made up.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.350
Chenzhou.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.160
Do you really

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.030
mean what you say?

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.640
Chenzhou,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:25.590
I understand what you truly want.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.170
I'll make this trip for you.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.830
Master!

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:40.550
Master.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.810
Be careful, Master.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:46.070
Master.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.830
Why am I still alive?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.400
The Chief gave you the Azure Heaven Elixir.

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.150
That's what saved your life.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.010
What about the Chief himself?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.840
Don't worry, Master.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.680
The Chief is fine.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.310
He ordered me to take good care of you.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.350
I was planning

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:26.110
to save the Chief.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.250
I didn't expect that...

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.830
in the end,

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.930
I would be saved by him once again.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.330
Thanks to the Chief.

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160
Master, in this life, you'll only risk

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:46.750
your life for the Chief and Shirong.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.280
Then at the mourning hall...

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:56.470
Master, you'd risk your life to save me?

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:06.880
Master, why did you save me?

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.000
No reason.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.160
Master.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.850
You've changed.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.010
I'll bring you your medicine.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.200
The tracking bees have responded—

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.460
southwest direction.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:01.590
Miss Tang,

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.510
Qiushui wants you to apply the tracking bee powder

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.640
to the tiger tally.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.750
The Northern Wasteland army has already marched toward Immortal Pass!

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:21.920
The time has come.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:23.550
From now on,

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.630
the elite advance troops shall depart in batches.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.920
Attack...

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.080
the Immortal Pass from within!

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.640
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:13.640
Wu Jie is of no use to us now.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.160
Please listen carefully to my arrangements, 3 seniors.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.680
Next, escort Wu Jie to Wansong Pavilion.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:38.830
After that, please gather the Northern Wasteland forces at Immortal Pass

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:40.490
and fight with all your might.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.200
Fifth Thug, I've mapped out that place.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.480
That water fortress doesn't have just one entrance,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.070
but these two entrances—one large and one small.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.070
I've marked them both clearly.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:12.200
They're about the same distance, right?

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.730
Yes, yes.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.510
We almost got caught.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.680
That lair in the Long River waterways

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.920
is hidden incredibly well.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.720
Yes, indeed.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.160
You all did a good job.

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:23.590
Fifth Thug,

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:24.640
the five of us are of one mind, right?

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.970
-Right!
-That's right.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:27.270
One mind, one purpose.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.310
Qiushui!

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.790
Something terrible has happened!

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.070
The men you sent to watch the waterways

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.920
have indeed discovered hidden Northern Wasteland elite troops.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.650
They're heading toward Immortal Pass right now!

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.200
It seems the Northern Wastelanders' sinister ambitions

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.730
can no longer be concealed.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.690
But with General Wu absent,

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.920
if the Northern Wastelanders launch a major assault,

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.380
we won't be able to hold out at Immortal Pass.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.680
Let's do this:

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.110
Prince Liang,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.440
take some men to reinforce Immortal Pass.

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.550
I'll go to the water fortress to rescue General Wu.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.400
That's the plan.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.530
We split up and move.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.030
-Alright!
-Alright!

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.510
Since fate has made me cannon fodder in this martial world,

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.190
I'll trample all of Daxi

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.710
under my feet!

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.670
Rong.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.320
Chenzhou...

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.510
You won't die.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.550
It's too late.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.480
I...

00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.960
I know there's no hope for me.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.720
Don't waste your energy on me anymore.

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.400
Rong.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.480
I'll take you.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.760
Let's rescue General Wu.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.120
Alright then.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.150
Let's go.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.360
You finally

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.400
rescued

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:57.710
General Wu yourself.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.560
You've fulfilled your wish.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.920
Rong,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:25.560
I'm coming to accompany you.

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:36.320
Life...

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.340
is truly as cold and desolate as snow.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.280
-Chief!
-Chief!

00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.510
Chief.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:02.190
Chieftess.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:07.970
What you left unfinished,

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:12.880
I will finish for you.
