[Echoes of the Self]

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.240
Your Highness.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.040
I told you I'm a good person.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.160
What are you doing?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.400
It's an emergency.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480
Once we get to where we need to go,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.560
someone will explain everything to you.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.120
You only need to know that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.450
I'm here to protect you.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.750
Let's be clear.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.880
Do not bite me again!

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.630
Okay.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.230
Help!

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.860
Someone's kidnapping me!

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.330
Help!

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.039
Are they

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:11.840
the people you wanted me to meet?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.210
They're from the Eastern Palace?

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.550
Hand over the princess quietly

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.850
and I'll grant you an intact corpse.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.510
Take the princess away first!

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.200
Protect the princess!

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.330
Move quickly!

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.600
Let's go!

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.470
After them!

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.750
Don't let them escape!

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.390
Your Highness!

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.600
Your Highness, hurry up and go!

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.290
Hya!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.800
Hya!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.520
Whoa!

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.840
Surround them!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.180
It seems Your Highness
is determined to kill us.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.320
You're the real Princess of Daqing, right?

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.230
Take them all away!

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.250
Your Highness!

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.720
I am Prince Yan's lieutenant.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.440
I cannot obey

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.970
Crown Prince Shu's orders.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.160
Liang Feng.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.240
Who gave you the courage to defy me?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.580
I did.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:11.650
Shu.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.480
Military orders supersede all else.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.280
You know that.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.550
Yan,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.390
you arrived quite quickly.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.430
So this means

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.350
she is the real Princess of Daqing, right?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.920
Isn't the Princess of Daqing
at your residence?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.960
This woman

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.630
is merely a witness to the robbery
at the Princess of Daqing's posthouse.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.960
If she's just a witness,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.360
it makes no difference
whether you take her away

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.280
or I do.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.140
But I am in charge of this case.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.000
So, there's no need to bother you,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.079
lest Father hold me accountable.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.040
Besides,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.680
many things

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.050
are not what they appear to be.

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.150
Shu, if you want to know the truth,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.310
there's no rush.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.490
What if I say no?

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.370
What if I insist on keeping her?

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.700
Then, I have no choice but

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.720
to follow official protocol.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.000
How dare you, Li Yan!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.640
Shu!

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.390
If I forcibly take her today,

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.170
things might become difficult to resolve.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.130
Everyone, stand aside.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.340
Let them go.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.500

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.810
to keep

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.480
this jade pendant well.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.610
At a critical moment,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.250
maybe

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.220
it can save your life.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.960
What's so special about it?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.550
I feel like

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.080
I've seen the pattern somewhere before.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.960
What was Mother trying to tell me?

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.240
This is
the peace-making marriage document.

[Yunrui-Daqing Peace-Making
Marriage Letter]

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.240
There are official seals of both kingdoms
on the document.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.480
But something seems different.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.230
What exactly is different?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.920
Guards!

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.600

Lieutenant Liang.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.800
What happened?

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.290
Your Highness was wounded
by a poisoned arrow.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.880
The doctor is treating her now.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.010
How was she injured?

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.320
I was ordered by His Highness
to escort the princess back.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.020
But unexpectedly,

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.790
we were ambushed by men
of the Crown Prince.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.830
The Crown Prince?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.680
Be ambushed?

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.010
There are many suspicious points
in this matter.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.930
Liang Feng.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:30.950
You may leave now.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.230
Your Highness,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.420
I've finished the treatment.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.460
She is conscious

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.790
but still very weak.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.320
You may go.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.159
Yes.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.320
I'll go in and see her.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.080
It's you.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.240
Finally we met,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.440
Princess Fu Wei of Daqing.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.280
I never thought I would see you again.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.490
I made you my stand-in

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.650
just because I didn't want
to lose my freedom.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.460
It was a desperate situation.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.990
So, I resorted to this plan.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.720
You didn't want to lose your freedom,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.330
so you thought it was acceptable for me
to die in your place, huh?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.840
About the attack at the posthouse,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.440
I knew it afterward.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.240
I can promise you that

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.030
I had nothing to do with it.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.230
Your jade pendant isâ€¦

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.170
This is the royal jade pendant of Daqing.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.710
You mean

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.420
the Daqing royal jade pendant
the princess wears

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.980
is the same as Madam Wang's?

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.790
When I was young,

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.270
I saw

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.770
the jade pendant on Zhou Kui.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.390
Before my mother died,
she gave me this pendant,

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.720
saying it could save me.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.610
What exactly

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.370
is the connection between the two things?

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:13.590
Could Zhou Kui

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.300
have connections
with the Daqing royal family?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.280
I'm not sure.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.530
But he has served as Minister of Rites
for many years.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.390
He must know many inside stories.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.060
Besides this matter,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.370
there's something else I don't understand.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.670
Why did Crown Prince Shu

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.670
want to kill the Princess of Daqing?

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.250
What connection is there between them?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.640
The assassins who pursued the princess

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.620
carried

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:38.340
tokens of the Eastern Palace.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.250
But

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.320
they might not be Shu's men.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.210
Why do you trust him so much?

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.160
Then why must you suspect him?

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.410
Because I know who he is now

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.080
and what a person he will become.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.140
I know how he will ascend to the throne

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.650
and what he will do after that.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.760
I also know that one day,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.360
we will be killed by him.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.850
I know it's hard for you

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.370
to accept it right now.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.200
But people's minds are unpredictable.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.360
Many things

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.250
are destined to happen.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.310
They are destined to happen

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.800
but haven't happened yet.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.220
Isn't that right?

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.320
Fu Wei.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.760
I believe in reincarnation

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.610
and karma.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.330
Since you've returned before the end,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:46.690
it proves that

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.280
everything here

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.470
and every person here

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.670
has a chance to be changed and redeemed.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.260
You want to save Miss Ruoxi

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.460
and yourself

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.900
because you believe everything here

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.910
can be changed.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.810
I believe in you.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.330
I also believe in Shu.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.120
I believe in the person I remember.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.280
Life and death

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.720
are mutual causation.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.640
Perhaps I shouldn't use memories
from the past life

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.210
to prematurely judge

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.810
others.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.200
I need to return to Zhou's Mansion.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.280
Do you want to go back as Zhou Ruoxi?

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.900
We have to investigate
the loan-sharking conspiracy,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.310
the truth behind the assassination
on the Princess of Daqing,

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.310
and whether Zhou Kui
and Crown Prince Shu are involved

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.170
from the source.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.500
But do you have to go back?

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.630
There might be another way.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.610
I have no choice.

Fu Wei.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.640
Yan.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.280
Wait for me.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.610
Here you are.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:02.250
Take this.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.420
Since you're going back,

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.600
take this with you.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.660
At least

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.140
you can have something to
protect yourself.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.400
This is for you.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.210
While I'm away,

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:13.960
you can use it to protect yourself.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.880
I've improved

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.010
this crossbow's power

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:17.110
and firing speed.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.840
Try it.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.660
Aim at one spot.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.590
Got it?

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:26.380
Yes.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.120
Your crossbow skills in the past life

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.720
was also taught by me, right?

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.840
Yes.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.610
Stay safe.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:08.080
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.320
The real princess was taken away by Yan.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.360
All leads have gone cold.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.110
A month ago,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:24.600
during peace marriage negotiations
between Daqing and Yunrui,

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.380
[Order]

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.690
some disguised Daqing rebels infiltrated
the merchant convoy

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:30.370
and entered Yunrui.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:33.250
I sent spies to investigate.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:34.980
Eventually,

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:35.670
I received information about their troop
gathering and smuggling operations.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:38.140
[Smuggling weapons and money]

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.280
However, my spies disappeared.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.510
The Eastern Palace tokens

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.510
have also vanished without a trace.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.120
All of this is because of Daqing.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.720
Now the real princess

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.340
is with Yan.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.340
I have no choice but
to use this fake one now.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:04.270
[The princess was shot by a poisoned arrow
and may die soon.]

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.780
My Lord, Lady Ruoxi has returned.

Father.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.270
Where have you been these days?

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.090
Since my mother passed away,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.940
I've been restless every day.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.620
I wanted to pray for Mother at the temple.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.840
It was wrong of me

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.590
for not telling you in advance.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.280
Praying?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.500
Why were you gone for so long?

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.000
After I left the temple,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.310
I found the road was washed out by floods.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.710
I searched for a long time

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.340
and walked for many days
before I could return.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.890
What are you waiting for?

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:05.050
[Deep Roots; Lush Branches]

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.890
Yes.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.260
Crown Prince Shu has ordered

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.650
to lift the Crown Princess's confinement.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:27.330
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.580
Why did they leave?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.810
What is the Crown Prince planning now?

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.530
Your Highness.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.860
Your Highness.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.900
The Crown Prince has lifted
your confinement.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.300
Has something happened?

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.690
You mean at the Crown Prince's residence?

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.610
Nothing special happened.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:51.730
However,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.160
Lady Ruoxi has returned.

Miss Zhou Ruoxi.

Your Highness.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.520
Where are you going?

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.850
Back to Zhou's Mansion.

Fu Wei?

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.540
Wasn't she killed by me?

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.890
Why is she still alive?

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:35.810
I'm not dead.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:39.030
You must be disappointed, right?

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.750
So what if you're still alive?

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.330
Now,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:45.770
I am the Princess of Daqing.

I am the Crown Princess of Yunrui.

But you

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.270
are nothing but a concubine's daughter
of the Zhou family.

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.510
I want to see

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.740

I won't fight you
for the position of Crown Princess.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.050
Because I'm not
the Princess of Daqing at all.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.470
Then who exactly are you?

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.760
I am your future self
