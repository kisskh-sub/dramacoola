(Li Zixuan Suffers due to Villains Act)

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.760
These tea roots need to
be picked out, right?

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.840
Young Master, Madam.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.480
More people have come
for Madam's milk tea.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.560
They're the relatives

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.560
of your aunt's nephew.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.760
But the milk tea Madam made this morning

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.280
was all given away.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.880
Then tell them to come again
tomorrow morning.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.920
We'll give them
the first cup of milk tea tomorrow.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.320
No way!

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.800
If we keep giving it away,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.320
how can we run a business?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.640
Since the milk tea is so popular,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.480
why don't we

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.320
just open a milk tea shop?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.400
Here's something you may not know.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.360
The tea trade has its own rules.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.680
As a tea planter and processor,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.080
we can't engage in the business
of the tea house.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.360
Then how come Mr. Wang

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.920
can operate a tea house?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.640
Mr. Wang disregards the rules,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.400
so the entire tea trade despises him.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.000
Well...

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.640
I have an idea.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.600
We'll neither break the rules

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.160
nor hinder our milk tea

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.720
business.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.040
We'll set up a stall

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.040
and use bamboo tubes as cups,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800
focusing on pickup and delivery service.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.320
Pickup?

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.760
Delivery service?

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.920
Pickup means

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.720
customers order milk tea,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.800
pick it up here, and take home.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.120
This way,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.960
we can save on the rental costs

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.480
of the tea house.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.480
Delivery service means

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.720
recording customers' addresses
in advance

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.560
and sending staff
to deliver milk tea to customers.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.000
No matter how far they are,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.040
they can still enjoy our milk tea.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.920
This way, we keep the rules

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.440
while expanding our milk tea business.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.760
Don't you agree?

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.160
Yes.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.760
Let's do it.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.800
Cuicui,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.400
it's done.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.280
All done?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.080
Look.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.440
What do you think of this map?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.000
There's a shorter route we can add.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.400
Where?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.400
Right here.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.280
Let's mark it there.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.960
Got it.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.080
Go straight and turn left.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.160
Where is this pasted?

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.680
This one?

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.720
Look.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.160
(Li's Milk Tea)
Just like this.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.120
Tomorrow our shop opens.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.600
I want you to invite
all scholars in Haiqing

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600
to come.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.960
When they come,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.640
I'll give them milk tea for free.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.600
Buy three cups, get one free.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.200
Welcome, everyone.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.720
Remember to leave a good review.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.920
Have these scholars

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.200
advertise our milk tea

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.240
just like we did just now.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.280
Why?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.000
It's for promotion.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.920
Think about it.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.200
All these scholars

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.080
drink our milk tea

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.600
and compose poems when inspired.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.440
Their works will spread,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.640
attracting more customers naturally.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.240
More customers

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.440
mean higher sales,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.800
improving our reputation naturally.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.000
Would we care about

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.280
a few cups for free?

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.360
Makes sense.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.000
You two, don't make this crooked.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.760
Yes, Madam.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.000
This should have your portrait.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.280
Don't you think it might be strange?

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.320
I mean your cartoon portrait.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.120
Cartoon?

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.240
I don't understand.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.400
Like those portraits

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.120
seen on advertisements.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.440
(Li's Milk Tea)

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.240

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.200
Mr. Wei.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.280
Congratulations.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.440
Today,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.760
I came to give you a surprise.

00:05:02.016 --> 00:05:03.712
(Top Milk Tea)

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.120
Top Milk Tea?

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.240
The nobles in the palace

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.080
tried the milk tea and adored it.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.560
So they bestowed this plaque.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.000
We're grateful for their favor.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.120
No need for modesty.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.880
You deserve it.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680
You flatter me.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.520
Xiaotang deserves all the credit.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.920
Come on.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.720
We're a married couple.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.680
We share the honor.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.280
Right.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.160
A married couple shares everything.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.440
Anyway, don't let this go to your heads.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.360
Yes.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.720
Father, let me show you inside.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.640
Okay.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.280
This way.

Is the location

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.720
of my stall good?

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.160
Sure, good location.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.760
Mr. Li.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.000
Congratulations.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.920
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

Thank you all.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.240
Congratulations
on earning Top Tea title.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.360
Not really.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.360
That's Top Milk Tea,

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.760
not Top Tea.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.280
It's the same.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.600
Why quibble over wording?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.800
Congratulations.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.640
You've restored your family's honor.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.920
(Haiqing Town)
You deserve Top Tea title.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.840
Thank you.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.640
My family has won the Top Tea title,

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.280
which also brings glory to Haiqing.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.200
Everyone is happy.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.560
- Well said.
- Well said.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.400
Li Zixuan.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.920
Now that major matters

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.600
are mostly settled,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.080
is it time for us

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.280
to get closer?

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.240
Well...

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.000
Come on.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.360
You've won the Top Tea title,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.280
so honor your promise!

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.320
Xiaotang.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.520
We've won the Top Milk Tea title,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.080
not the Top Tea title.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.360
Come on.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.320
I heard everything last night.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.480
Thank you.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.080
My family won the Top Tea title.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.760
I just didn't want
to waste time convincing them.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.680
That's it.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.720
Stop making excuses!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.480
We must get closer.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.760
Xiaotang, we'll discuss this
tonight at home.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.040
It's improper to talk about it

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.360
in broad daylight.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.320
You're a grown man.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.600
Why are you so coy?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.480
Madam Li!

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.960
Madam Li!

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.440
What's wrong?

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.600
After drinking your tea, my wife

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.720
has an upset stomach

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.600
and diarrhea.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.920
Check on her immediately!

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.040
That's impossible!

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.680
Our milk and tea leaves

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.520
are very fresh.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.960
I don't know why.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.000
I kept the leftover tea

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.760
at home.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.360
Come and check it out!

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.640
Fine, lead the way.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.360
Cuicui, I'll go with him.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.680
Alright.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.560
This way.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.480
You live here?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.280
This place

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.080
doesn't look inhabited.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.000
Answer me!

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.480
Young Master.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.760
Any special plans today?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.240
Without plans,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.360
I can't light candles?

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.640
You just bathed and got changed,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.640
and even used incense.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.840
Are you going out?

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.480
Shut up.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.480
Young Master! Something happened!

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.520
My lady seems to have been kidnapped!

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.880
What?

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.360
During closing time,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.360
a man claimed our milk tea had issues

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.000
and asked her to go and check with him.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.120
She went with him

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.440
but hasn't returned yet.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.560
We asked around

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.080
and heard

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.000
someone saw a carriage

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.600
taking her outside the town.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.840
Cuicui, report it to the yamen first.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880
Ning An, come with me!

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.000
Yes.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.880
Who are you?

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.320
Why did you kidnap me?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.400
What do you want?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.960
Tell me the milk tea recipe.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.040
Wait,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.800
you kidnapped me just

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.560
for a milk tea recipe?

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.000
Don't talk nonsense!

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.320
Speak now.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.880
If I tell you the recipe,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.960
will you let me go?

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.720
Do you have a choice?

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.520
Speak now!

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.520
Alright, I'll tell you.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.160
Write it down.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.800
I'm saying it now.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.560
Here it comes.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.280
Three liang of pre-Qingming tea,
and three liang of cheese.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.440
Cheese?

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.880
Don't know how to write it?

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.360
Three liang

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.520
of milk left for seven days and nights.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.840
Put all ingredients

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.120
into a pot and boil.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.640
Once it smells burnt,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.600
add malt syrup.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.200
Malt...

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.080
And cheese.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.360
What?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.280
Malt syrup, right?

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.440
Add malt syrup, cheese,

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.440
the pre-Qingming tea,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.280
cinnamon, bay leaves, star anise,

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.640
white pepper, and black pepper.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.680
That's about it.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.160
Mix everything together

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160
and boil again.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:48.320
Let it cool before serving.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.200
Is this recipe

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560
genuine?

00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.200
Of course!

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.200
It's my perfected recipe.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:04.880
You have it now.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.960
At least it won't be lost.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.360
Make good use of it!

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:10.520
Good.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.720
You're smarter than you look.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.840
Now that you have

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.360
the recipe,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.000
can you release me

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.040
right now?

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.400
I changed my mind.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.680
What do you mean?

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.960
Listen.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.520
When you found me earlier,

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.960
my maid Cuicui witnessed it!

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.480
If I don't return,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.880
they'll suspect you!

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.400
You'll fall into water accidentally,

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.200
which has nothing to do with me.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.560
Don't you dare!

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.800
Stay back!

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.520
Help!

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.960
Help!

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.240
Help!

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.760
Help!

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.720
Scream louder!

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.040
Xiaotang!

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.120
Madam!

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.720
Xiaotang!

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.400
Madam!

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.800
Xiaotang!

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:20.800
Madam!

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.520
Xiaotang!

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.160
Madam!

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.040
Madam!

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.160
Young Master, the carriage!

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.760
Madam!

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.360
Xiaotang!

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.680
Madam!

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.280
Young Master.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.760
It's Madam's.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.640
Xiaotang.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.280
Xiaotang?

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:04.920
Take it.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.720
Young... Young Master,
what are you doing?

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.880
Young Master!

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.960
Young Master!

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.800
Young Master!

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.760
Come back up here, Young Master!

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.240
You can't swim, Young Master!

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.400
Struggling in vain,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.640
the beauty perished.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.960
Wei Xiaotang died.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.560
Li Zixuan clearly couldn't swim.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.360
Why would he risk drowning
to save Wei Xiaotang?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.360
They were only bound by a contract.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.360
Yet he willingly died

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.160
for Wei Xiaotang.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.560
This is love.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.840
He did it all for love.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.320
(In the sixth year of Yuanfeng era,
Qin Si set up a trap with milk tea.)

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.640
(He kidnapped Wei Xiaotang
for a milk tea recipe.)

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.680
(Upon success,
he threw Wei Xiaotang into the water.)

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.560
(Zixuan and Wei Xiaotang)

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.240
(were related by contract.)

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.640
(Yet he fell in love wth her.)

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.040
(He tried to save her.)

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.800
(Xiaotang survived.)

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.280
(Zixuan met his end.)

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.560
(What a pity!)

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.280
(Zixuan had no regrets.)

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.200
It's messed up.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.200
Completely!

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.520
Now we have a new story.
