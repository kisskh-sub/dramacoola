=Episode 17=

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.320
Shi'an's mother...

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.320
Mother.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.680
Shi'an's mother, my poor child.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.360
They killed Madam Lu.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.720
The Inner Bureau killed her.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.960
I saw it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.960
You did this!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.520
Exactly!

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.280
- Yes.
- They did!

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.720
- Yes.
- They did!

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.600
Blood demands blood!

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.720
Where's the justice?

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.720
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920
please let me say something.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.720
The Inner Bureau surrounded
my family these past days

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.240
for valid reasons.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.800
Your clamoring for our vindication

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
may hinder Lord Shen's judgment.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.560
Should it endanger your own safety,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.600
we would bear grave sin.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.200
Lord Shen is too tyrannical!

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.080
Exactly.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.640
- Utterly tyrannical!
- How can this be?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.560
Mind your words.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.960
The Lu family acts with integrity.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800
We believe justice resides
in people's hearts.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.360
Please tell this to our neighbors.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.760
These days,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.160
the blockade halted the pearl trade,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.400
affecting everyone's income.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.400
I offer my deepest apologies.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.880
But rest assured.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.520
If you face hardships,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.160
the Lu shops will extend credit.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.560
I just ask for one thing.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.520
Stop harassing the Governor-General.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.320
We're commoners,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.960
and he's an official.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.080
We must obey.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.560
Madam Lu is really kind.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.520
Yes. Her kindness shines.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.560
She's truly kind.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.480
What can we do?

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.680
Indeed.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.600
Shi'an, don't blame

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.960
these Inner Bureau soldiers
for your mother's death.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.720
They followed orders.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.480
Pity me, an old woman,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.360
to bury the young once more.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.880
Madam.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.480
Madam.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.640
Madam.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.760
Lu Shi'an said when his mother raged,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.000
they confined her to her chamber.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.600
She never went out.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.480
You think her death was suspicious?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.600
Did you find anything?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.680
Just conjecture.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.880
After burial,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.320
we'll examine the corpse.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.520
What?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.200
She was Jin's grandmother, after all.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.240
Look how she ended up.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.880
Quite tragic.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.200
Besides, Madam Lu's words today

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.720
will put you in jeopardy.

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:53.120
You're worried about me?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.760
I'm talking seriously to you.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.200
The worse my position,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.680
the more our enemy panics.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.520
As the verse goes:
Dark clouds gather before the storm.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.856
(Memorial Tablet of My Late Mother)

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.280
Some faint, some die,

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.560
and others flee. I think
the Lu family will crumble eventually.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480
Must you chatter?

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.120
My mother just passed.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.560
Let her rest.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.080
Lu Shi'an,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.600
burning paper is useless.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.360
Where's your spine?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.400
If I were you,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.640
I'd avenge my mother!

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.440
Shut up.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.040
I'm mourning here out of wifely duty.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.440
I didn't kill her.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.480
Shut up!

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.040
It's all Ye Qinglan's...

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.040
Shut your mouth!

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.880
You're insane.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.680
Get out! Out!

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.880
Out!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.480
After you.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.160
Please.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.400
You invited me for tea

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.720
to teach me governance again?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.360
You jest, my lord.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.960
You've become

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.480
the terror of Ningzhou.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.640
I wouldn't dare act rashly.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.720
Are you finding creative ways
to insult me?

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.120
My lord, please stop teasing me.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.920
My lord, please look.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.640
Seaweed twist pastries.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.000
Glutinous rice cakes.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.840
Steamed layer cake.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.720
These are all local specialties.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.320
Please have a taste.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.520
Quite good.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.680
But they're merely snacks.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.920
Is there any main dish?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Of course, there is.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.320
This main dish

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.120
is specially prepared for you.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.040
Jia Wu,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.960
you colluded with Xia Jinzhi and pirates

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.000
to kidnap the Lu family's concubine.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.440
Do you confess?

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.320
I never colluded with Lady Jinzhi.
I acted alone.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.480
Xia Jinzhi is my daughter,

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.240
but as Prefect

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.920
and paternal magistrate,

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.560
I'd never shield criminals
or bend the law.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.720
Confess truthfully,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.280
and I might plead mercy from Lord Shen

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.320
to grant you an intact corpse.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.720
Lady Jinzhi is innocent.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.040
I consulted a fortune-teller
who deluded me,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.080
claiming I'd gain sudden wealth.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.080
She connected me with pirates,

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.960
leading to my rash decision
to kidnap her.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.440
But the scheme came to light,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.440
and I feared you might know it,
so I sought to silence the witness.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.880
You...

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.080
Well, well, Jia Wu.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.560
You nearly ruined
my lifelong reputation.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.960
I deserve death.
I submit to your punishment.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.080
My lord, I entrust the prisoner to you.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.520
As he's from your household,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.160
it's proper you handle his sentencing.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:41.880
Contaminated?

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.600
What a waste.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.880
Servants. Bring a fresh one.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.680
No need.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:49.960
What?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.400
Are you displeased with this main dish?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.840
Lord Xia,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.880
your servants remain unwaveringly loyal.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.960
Servants are but raised hounds.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.320
What hound doesn't stay loyal
to its master?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.440
Don't you agree, my lord?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.960
Now that the dog's been killed,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.280
do you have words for me?

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.720
You heard

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720
and witnessed everything.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.280
Jia Wu confessed all crimes.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.240
Please stop implicating the Lu family.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.640
Or this will become irreparable.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.400
As you stated,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.640
he's merely a dog.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.000
How can a dog's words hold credibility?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.960
No wonder we couldn't locate Jia Wu.

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.920
He was in Prefect Xia's home.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600
For the Lu family's sake,

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.960
he'd kill decades-old confidant.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.360
What are you thinking, my lord?

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.400
I was thinking

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.040
if he'd kill his own confidant

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.920
for the Lu family,

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.400
should they demand his life someday,

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.400
would he comply?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.200
You mean Prefect Xia
obeys the Lu family?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.880
Madam Lu?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.800
We've only besieged the Lus briefly,

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.440
yet Prefect Xia grows restless.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.960
In truth, he and Jia Wu

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.000
are both dogs.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.720
Only their loyalty levels differ.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.680
These remain mere conjectures.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.720
We lack evidence.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.120
Then let the dog get desperate

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.080
and see which wall it leaps.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.840
Though Jin remains unconscious,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.960
her bruises are fading.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.480
Gao Fu said

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.800
we don't need
to apply leeches every day.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.200
You should return to handle
your mother's funeral.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.680
A'man, don't send me away.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.520
You and Jin are my only family now.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.680
You still have Xia Jinzhi

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.560
- and your grandmother.
- It's different.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.120
You and Jin are my true kin.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.840
I came to give blood

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.440
for Jin's treatment willingly
as a father.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.760
Even though Lord Shen's men
always treat me

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.240
like a criminal.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.680
But in the face of paternal love,

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.360
what does a man's pride matter?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.800
A'man.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.400
I've been thinking these days.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.200
I couldn't protect you,

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.200
our daughter,

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.840
and also my own mother.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.400
I'm not fit to be called a man.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.880
I don't know

00:12:15.232 --> 00:12:16.320
if I'll get another chance

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.160
to make things right for you both.

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.720
Here, wipe it.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.400
My lord,

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.000
I'm here just to give Jin my blood.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.160
My mother's death was accidental.
It has nothing to do with you.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.400
Please don't blame me.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.320
Stop tormenting him.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.440
Gao Fu.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:54.920
Yes?

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.040
Escort him out.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.560
Understood.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.560
Master Lu,

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.000
please.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:15.040
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.920
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu...

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.480
The Lu family has been doing good deeds.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.760
We've never committed evil acts.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.440
I'll stake my life
to prove our integrity!

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.240
- Wang!
- Wang!

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.520
- Wang!
- Wang!

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.240
- Wang.
- Wang.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.000
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.600
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.200
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:45.080
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.280
- The Lu family is innocent!
- The Lu family is innocent!

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.120
Why would these commoners
risk their lives?

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.640
The Lu family has
strong public support in Ningzhou.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.520
Until the capital's edict arrives,

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.960
the people won't believe
the Lus committed crimes.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:11.560
It's been three days.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.840
Why hasn't the decree arrived yet?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.760
We can't afford any mishaps.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.960
I'll send men to meet them
and bring the decree bearer back.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.320
- Go now!
- Understood.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.440
A'man,

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.040
did I frighten you?

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.400
I just don't understand

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.920
why he chose to take his own life.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.720
There must be foul play behind this.
