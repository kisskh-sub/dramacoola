Yot.

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:20.200
Yot.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.040
Fuck!

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.920
What the fuck are you doing?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.030
Why the fuck are you grabbing my junk!?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.440
Yot.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.220
I...

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.070
You shouldn't have crossed my line like that, M.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.550
I've always trusted you.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.660
You are my most beloved friend.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.280
So why the fuck would you do this shitty shit to me, you bastard!?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.070
Yot.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.280
It wasn't my intention.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.010
I wasn't in my right mind.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.270
From now on, I don't know if I can trust you, M!

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.740
Yot.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.769
Yot. I'm sorry.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.480
Get out!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.370
Get out of my house!

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.130
Go die wherever you want, you fucking bastard!

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.240
What the hell is that noise?

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.090
Shit!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.540
Get out of my house!

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.560
Go die wherever you want, you fucking bastard!

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.320
Yot.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.800
I'm sorry.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.540
M.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.080
What happened?

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.520
Do you still dare to stay here?

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.600
Huh!?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.720
Get up!

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.630
So you're not going?

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.200
You really gonna stay?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.570
M!

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.920
M!

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.660
Yot!

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.760
What happened?

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.810
Will you follow M?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.640
Fuck it!

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.600
I don't care where he goes to die.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.810
But...

00:02:34.811 --> 00:02:36.869
If you want, just follow him, Arm.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:37.880
I won't go!

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.120
Get out of the way!

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.240
Bring me alcohol, Arm!

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.160
But... Yot.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.570
Alcohol. Go get it for me.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.360
Hello.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.590
Your incense.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.960
Please come this way.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.090
Thank you.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.820
Say goodbye to him for the last time.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.220
Thank you.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.650
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.930
I never imagined he'd leave us this early.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.990
Thank you for coming to my son's funeral.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.139
I'm sorry for your loss.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.090
Thank you.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.000
What? Why did you kick the door?

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.520
Jiji. What are you doing here?

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.780
I'll take a shower and go back to M's funeral.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.000
Why did you come back? What about the others?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.220
Yeah. I'm tired, so I'll come back first.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.640
Yot, are you okay?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:28.530
Yeah.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.740
So... since you're tired...

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.080
Would you like to take a shower together?

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.340
Okay.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.100
Come on, babe.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.140
Yot.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.860
Don't rush me.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.380
Slowly.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.750
We still need to go out.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.800
Fuck!

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.450
Huh? Yot.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.160
What's wrong with you?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.120
Jiji, continue taking a shower.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.180
I'm not in the mood anymore.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.310
What?

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.560
What's wrong with him?

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.240
M.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.320
I'm your brother.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.580
Don't haunt me.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.490
Damn it...

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.760
Hey! Fuck! What is that?

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.100
M.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.610
I'm your brother.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.480
Don't haunt me.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.030
Don't forget that I'm your brother.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.760
Don't haunt me.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.120
Reverend Father!

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.760
What? You're so loud.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.270
I think, should we change our route?

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.520
Huh? Why?

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.890
It's nothing much, but how about we change our path once in a while?

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.400
Why do you want to change our route today?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.780
Just go along our normal route.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.130
This is the usual route where people wait to give alms.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.450
Why did you stop walking, Reverend Father?

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.840
You may not even realize what you're doing.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.680
Are you talking to me, Reverend Father?

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.120
I'm helping you with the alms round.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.620
But now, you and your friend are in different realms.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.780
It's better if we go our separate ways.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.000
Please don't tease me, Reverend Father.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.850
If not, I won't wait for you anymore.

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.050
I'm leaving now, Reverend Father.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.190
The more you resist my words,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.690
the burden of sin will grow heavier upon you.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.090
That's my final warning.

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.210
Let humans be with humans,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.010
and ghosts with ghosts.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.550
What the hell is this?

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.300
It's a cold packs.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.700
Did you grow up without knowing what a cold pack was?

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.240
Not like that.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.520
I mean, why did you do this to me?

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.880
Have you ever seen a nurse wiping the doctor's sweat during surgery?

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.020
Yes, it's exactly like that.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.999
I've seen you repair a lot of cars,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:44.940
I'm worried you're getting exhausted.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.950
Many thanks, Mr. nurse.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.960
Shit.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.650
I feel like I'm becoming more like a proper adult.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.210
Mr. nurse.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.020
Come to think of it,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:02.090
why don't you consider studying this?

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.880
It suits you.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.250
Why?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.550
Or is it because...

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.790
I gave you first aid after you fight with those out-of-town bikers?

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.090
And you are the loser.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.670
Loser my ass!

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.470
They ganged up on me.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.240
Looking back, it was worth it,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.280
because I got to date Jiji.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.140
Uh, M.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.450
Thank you so much for always being by my side.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.030
If it weren't for you, I might've died on the side of the street?

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:38.380
You? Die on the street?

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.090
You're Yot.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:49.420
Top dog in every damn league.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.940
Hey, you're just insulting me with that last part.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.310
Damn.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:55.610
Damn, you just low-key insulting me?

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.590
You wanna fight me now?

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.640
You wanna fight me?

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.630
Yot!

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.360
You guys are so ungrateful.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.070
You won't even touch the trash.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.760
Look.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.110
Yot!

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.050
Son!

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.550
Yot!

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.570
Oh. Are you working?

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.420
It's good that you're working.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.919
But seriously, what's wrong with you?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.590
Your friend just died, and you're not even going to his funeral?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.360
Why are you so angry at him?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.180
Don't blame me if your friend haunts you later.

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:53.840
Huh?

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.680
Aren't you going to answer me?

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.080
I'm confused.

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.060
Annoying.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.120
Then I'll go see my friend.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.970
Hey, rain, don't fall again!

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.000
I didn't bring an umbrella with me.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:09.920
What do I do if I get wet?

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.929
Hello, handsome.

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.180
Are you here?

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.300
I came to get my car. Oh.

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:24.820
I mean, CUM to get my car.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.680
Aren't you there?

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:27.830
Oh.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:30.130
You're down there, right?

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.430
Need a hand fixing your undercarriage?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.310
Okay, you didn't answer me.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.690
You're ignoring me. Playing hard to get.

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.200
I'll help you.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.550
Right now?

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:41.720
Okay, right now.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:43.310
1...

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.200
2...

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.320
3!

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.420
What the hell is that?

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:40.860
Shit!

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.150
Fuck!

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.779
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.130
Fuck! Fucking shit!

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.940
Shit.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.510
What the hell are you talking about, Arm?

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.400
Ghosts don't exist.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.850
Just try to show up,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.230
I'll kick his face so hard he'll forget he's even a ghost.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.840
Gosh, Yot.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.210
Hold on till I'm get back, then you can call the ghost out.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.730
Man, you...

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.000
So why did you come back home?

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.020
Your mom told me to come get you.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.740
You didn't go to M's funeral yesterday, did you?

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.220
But I already went yesterday.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.860
But you didn't step inside.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:07.390
Maybe...

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.700
the reason why M is haunting everyone like this

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:14.450
is that he still has unresolved worries.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.380
Worried about what?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.320
Or...

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.330
he's worried you won't get into university.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.930
Why does M have to worry about my university studies?

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.130
Honestly, you know better than anyone

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.720
how much M worries about...

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.360
About...

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.010
About the promise you made to him!

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.940
What the hell promise is that?

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.280
The promise you made to ordain for me.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:55.800
Hey!

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.570
Hey...

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.810
Why're you screaming?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.050
Sorry.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:01.470
Are you okay?

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.840
Nothing.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.010
Nothing at all.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.560
Head to the temple first,

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.900
I'll follow after I finish showering.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:16.720
Okay, then...

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.130
See you at the temple.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.590
I'd better head out quickly.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.140
Where did all the people go?

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.120
It's so quiet.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.870
Hey, look at this pavilion.

00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:59.910
There aren't many people here.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.350
So quiet.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.470
Don't joke around.

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:05.750
They just brought a body in here.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.199
Just happened.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.310
Did you know everyone around here's been haunted?

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.320
They've been haunted even during the daytime.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.870
Not surprise.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.980
Not many people came to the funeral.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:17.890
Umm, you're right.

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:20.590
When someone dies in such an unlucky way, it's probably hard to be reborn.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.199
What are you saying?

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.310
Be careful, he might come and haunting your ass.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.260
Ugh, I got goosebumps.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:26.290
Ugh, I'm heading back now.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.500
M, what about you?

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.630
Do you want a Western wife or a Thai wife?

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:44.350
M likes petite, fair-skinned, Asian-type girls.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.250
No matter where she's from, he's okay as long as she's fair-skinned and looks Asian.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.070
Yot.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.270
How the hell do you know my type?

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.970
Don't be embarrassed.

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:57.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.550
Looking at porn pics?

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.440
Is he your type?

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.620
Huh?

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.750
M!

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.810
You.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.980
Alright, listen.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.790
I...

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:07.590
Stop!

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.819
Why didn't you tell me this is your type?

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:12.690
Hey.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.640
I think your body kinda pretty similar to this.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:19.910
Mom, this is what girls are liking these days.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.720
Didn't you promise you'd ordain for me?

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.750
Shit!

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.570
Fuck!

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.120
Yot.

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:13.230
Please open the door.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.800
Are you jerking off in there?

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.790
Hurry up, I'm going to bed.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:22.880
Jerk M!

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.790
Stop haunting me.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.420
You're fucking dead!

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:29.190
What the fuck do you mean?

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.380
If I were dead, would I be standing right here?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.990
You're really dead.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.140
And now you're a ghost haunting me like this.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.360
What did you promise me?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.680
I was just saying that!

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.350
I didn't think you'd actually fucking die.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.290
I was just kidding!

00:25:50.291 --> 00:25:51.550
I don't actually want to ordain!

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:04.670
Fuck!

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.880
Fuck!

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.520
Damn.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.640
M.

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:25.430
M.

00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:27.630
Yot.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.900
Mom, help me!

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:29.930
- What's wrong?
- M's ghost, Mom!

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.449
- M's ghost!
- Not a ghost!

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.150
M's ghost!

00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:33.630
Get a grip!

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:34.740
- M's ghost!
- Yot!

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.990
M's ghost is haunting me, Mom!

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.360
Yot.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.150
Yot!

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.950
Get a grip!

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.320
I was still talking to him just now, Mom.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.220
M's ghost!

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:46.370
Yot.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.350
No, it isn't.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.710
What happened to your face?

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.370
I'm okay, forget it.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.190
Mom.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.510
I said, what happened to your face?

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.230
Did the loan sharks hurt you?

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:08.940
Forget it.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.590
Yot.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.070
Listen.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.380
I won't let myself lose anything else.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.330
Mom

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.470
will protect you.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.090
About ordaining,

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.030
if you're not willing,

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.250
then you don't have to.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.670
I'm okay.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:31.640
Mom.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.910
I've made up my mind.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.010
I've decided.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.420
I will be ordained.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:27:59.490
Yot.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.290
Listen to me.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.810
I may not be a perfect mother,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.070
but this mother

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:11.870
will always love you.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:14.510
Yot.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.130
I love you, my son.

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.910
I'm sorry for the past.

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.650
Can you forgive me?

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.740
- I love you, Yot.
- Me too, Mom... I’m sorry.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.840
I'm sorry.

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:37.790
I'm sorry, son.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.650
[We'll never leave each other, my best friend]

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.620
Jerk M.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.110
I'm sorry.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.610
I didn't think it would turn out like this.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.370
Please forgive me.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.460
Please forgive me, M.

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.260
Esāhaṃ bhante,

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.420

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.890

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:35.950
Body hair.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:37.850
Hair.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:46.940
Suci-ra-parinibbūtam pi,

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.090

labheyaṃ upasaṃpadaṃ.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.960
On the occasion of your ordination today,

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.040
you must seek your mother's forgiveness.

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:47.740
I respectfully bid farewell as I go forth into ordination.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:53.050
If I have ever done anything wrong to you,

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.230
whether to your face or behind your back,

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:58.860
I sincerely ask for your forgiveness.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:04.890
May this ordination go as I have intended.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:06.970
Yes.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.750
I always forgive you, Yot.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.700
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.590
I was never truly mad at you.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:36.530
Please be diligent in your monastic studies.

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.750
Okay?

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.470
Please be diligent in your monastic studies.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.310
Son.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.590
Thank you.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:22.660
I never thought this day would come.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.150
Do your best with the ordination, my dear.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.020
Okay?

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.400
Put your heart into studying the Dhamma.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:18.600
♫ Wishing you luck from now on ♫

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.310
♫ Stay strong and don't let sorrow take hold ♫

♫ Just wishing you sweet dreams from now on ♫

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.830
♫ Just the two of us know ♫

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:33.790
♫ When you feel lonely, ♫

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:37.590
♫ I'll stand by you, whether happiness or sadness ♫

♫ Please don’t cry, though fate pulled us apart too soon ♫

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.420
In my life,

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:51.030
other than my dad's garage,

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.780
I only have you

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:55.900
as my safe zone.

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:35.420
Please bless me.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:45.720
Yathā vārivahā pūrā.
Paripūrenti sāgaraṁ.

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:49.089
Evameva ito dinnaṁ.

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:51.330
Petānaṁ upakappati.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.589
Icchitaṁ patthitaṁ tumhaṁ.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.460
Khippameva samijjhatu.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.740
Sabbe pūrentu saṅkappā.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:03.040
Cando paṇṇaraso yathā.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:07.220
Maṇi jotiraso yathā.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:27.790
I'm going to order some equipment. Do you want anything?

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.570
Huh?

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.430
I need one battery.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.820
Battery, right?

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.400
Fan and serpentine belt too.

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:35.820
Fan...

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.230
Serpentine belt...

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:41.460
Okay, sure.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.430
This month's income is pretty good.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:48.090
3...

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:54.940
Client's arrived.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.150
Yot.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:09.830
Let's break up.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.430
I don't think we're compatible.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.350
Uh.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:16.670
He is Nont.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.030
My new husband.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.179
- Nont.
- Yes.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.189
Let's go. It's hot.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.870
I'm hungry.

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:40.210
As I expected.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.540
She changes men every time.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.670
Jeez, she's showing off her new man.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.060
Jeez, showing off a luxury car.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.350
That's supposed to be luxury?

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.910
I could buy it if I wanted to.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.000
Just ignore her, Mom.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.309
Okay, I'll ignore her.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:05.110
I wish her to get a good husband and be rich as she wants.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.790
Let's focus on our work.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:09.420
Is this all you need?

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:10.760
- Yes.
- Would you like anything else?

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.780
No, Mom. It's okay now.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.190
- Damn! What the fuck!?
- Hey, what?

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:49.560
You startled me.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:52.050
Huh?

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.410
There was no one in the car just now, right, Mom?

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.600
The car was shaking.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.260
That car hood was about to break my neck.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.790
No.

00:42:01.791 --> 00:42:03.660
There were only the two of us at the garage today.

00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:07.310
Arm isn't here, is he?

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.220
Arm went to see Reverend Father since morning.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.630
I heard he's going to university or something.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.210
I'll wait and see how long he can stay focused.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:26.770
Don't overthink it.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.700
Okay.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:44.639
♫ At least even though we are apart, we still got to know each other ♫

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.519
[We'll never leave each other, my best friend]
["I will wait for the day you come back"]

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:52.579
♫ This is all I can give you as a gift ♫

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.610
[We'll never leave each other, my best friend]
["I will wait for the day you come back"]
