=Episode 12=
(and an Entire Clan Is Executed)

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.480
(Confiscate their property,
search the residence, investigate.)

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.440
(The Mu clan must not be spared.)

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
(Every member of the Mu clan
shall be executed.)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
(His Majesty hereby decrees)

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.840
(that every member of the Mu clan
shall be executed.)

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.160
Why?

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.920
Assets seized and investigated…

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.800
The entire clan executed…

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.440
A single phrasing change

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.320
cost my entire family their lives…

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.320
Why?

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.080
Heaven's justice fails.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.200
If the wicked dare to wreak havoc,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.000
then let their laughter

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.200
turn to wails.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.040
(Li Cang)

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.240
Her Highness
destroyed an imperial edict.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.280
This is a grave crime.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.320
Seize her!

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.360
How dare you!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.200
I'm a princess of this nation,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.360
the emperor's
appointed heiress to Lord Yi.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.520
Who dares touch me?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.720
Our dynasty rules by law.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.280
Even the emperor, if he breaks the law,
answers like any commoner.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.760
Your Highness,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.360
do you intend to defy the law?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.240
Seize her at once!

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.920
Stop!

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.320
If the heiress to Lord Yi's guard
mounts an assassination

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.760
inside the palace,

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.760
by law I may have you
executed on the spot.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.200
Surrender at once.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.080
Chi Yu!

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.640
Take them both

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.080
to the imperial prison.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.640
Yes, sir.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.720
Chi Yu.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.400
Chi Yu!

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.600
Where are we?

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.520
This is

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.200
Li Cang's private prison.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.240
He intends to silence us.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.600
Don't worry.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.280
I'll get you out of here.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.920
Come on.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.920
And where do you think you're going?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.960
Li Cang,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.560
you, the Imperial Preceptor,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.280
are colluding with the Silver Fox Clan!

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.960
He is not colluding.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.640
He is a member of the Silver Fox Clan.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.080
If that is so,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.920
I will execute you

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.200
here and now

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.240
for destroying the imperial edict.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.160
Are you all right?

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.960
Curses!

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.400
The power of the pact is too strong.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.920
I must find another host.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.760
You are bestowed imperial favor,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.760
yet you do not repay it.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.720
Instead, you plot rebellion

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.480
to overturn the state!

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.240
Your heart is vile,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.000
and your deeds are despicable!

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.640
"Execute every member of the clan."

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.800
A single line
can trample lives so easily.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.800
Today,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.880
I'll make you taste the pain

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.680
of every single word!

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.720
(Father,)

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.360
(the wicked has received his due.)

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.680
(Can you see this from above?)

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.240
You've done it.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:47.880
He's dead.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.920
I'll borrow your body for now.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.680
I thought

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.680
that once the edict resurfaced,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.760
the Mu Residence's injustice
would be cleared.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.120
I never imagined Li Cang

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.680
would dare burn the edict
without reservation.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.280
Now,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.000
the evidence is nothing but ash.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.080
Reopening the Mu Residence case

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.000
will be even harder.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.040
What exactly is the Xuanzhu Jade?

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.840
Why does everyone want it?

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.640
A hundred years ago,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.600
the Scarlet Flame Clan of the north,
descended from the phoenix deities,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.440
held the earth's fiery veins.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.480
I was a general
of the Scarlet Flame Clan,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.720
raised alongside Yanlie,
the king of our clan.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.520
The Scarlet Flame and Silver Fox clans
were long at war.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.280
To end the war,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.080
I urged Yanlie to seal the peace

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.600
with a marriage to Princess Bai Li
of the Silver Fox Clan.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.920
We walked right into Bai Li's trap.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.800
Our peaceful life ended

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.080
with the arrival of the princess.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.200
I lost my divine power

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.160
and could no longer
feel human suffering.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.200
The Xuanzhu Jade is
the Scarlet Flame Clan's sacred relic,

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.240
the artifact that seals
the evil spirit An Sha.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.880
Because of that,
it holds the sun deity's power.

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.640
Whoever possesses the Xuanzhu Jade

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.280
holds the sun deity's might.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.200
All of this happened because of me.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.000
I trusted the enemy, and I was mistaken.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.680
Rest assured.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.000
I will honor our pact,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.760
return the Xuanzhu Jade to its place,

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.080
and revive your people.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.920
Do you understand?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.480
Your body will become

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.760
the Wangshu Vessel
to hold the Xuanzhu Jade.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.520
Even in death, you'll feel

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.400
the jade's burning, suffering

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.920
until your spirit is completely gone.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.080
Aren't you afraid?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.440
I'm not.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.400
I'm prepared for it.
