00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.557
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.977
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS WERE FILMED
IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAFETY GUIDELINES.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:18.953
{\an8}PREGNANT

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.375
{\an8}It feels like the blood of Jeong I-shin,
that monster who gave birth to me,

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:26.419
{\an8}is running through my veins.

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.217
{\an8}Jung-yeon, are you okay?

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:34.511
{\an8}Yeah, I'm fine.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.304
{\an8}I'm just feeling a little nauseous.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.549
I'LL BE AT AH-RA'S PLACE FOR A FEW DAYS
I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE THERE FOR YOU

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.060
Excuse us.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.814
I'll be in the car.

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:28.898
Okay.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:33.319
Pardon the intrusion,
but where are you off to?

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.571
A funeral.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:39.534
She does own
a valid driver's license, right?

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:46.749
Yes.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:35.173
Where's my compensation?

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:37.717
Sir.

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.636
You must be very upset,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.679
but why don't you come here and…

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.306
Let go of me.

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:46.184
You killed a perfectly healthy boy.

00:03:46.267 --> 00:03:47.310
Where's my compensation?

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:50.605
Who will compensate me?

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:57.612
- Sir.
- I should be compensated.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:03:59.447
- Sir.
- Let go.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.824
I should be compensated.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:14.295
But…

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.422
How do you know the deceased?

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.091
Well, we are…

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.221
I'm his older brother.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:25.473
Goodness. What a terrible tragedy
for such a young man.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.958
Min-jae said this was his happiest moment.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.002
This was the spot.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.465
It's really nice.

00:05:00.216 --> 00:05:01.467
He did a good job.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.138
Min-jae painted it, right?

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.140
He painted you and her together?

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:09.267
It's weird, isn't it?

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:14.689
I'm her biological son,
and I don't even want to look at her,

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.152
but despite not sharing
a drop of blood with her,

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.155
he missed her so dearly.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:25.325
Who cares about blood?

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.411
What they meant
for each other is what matters.

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.163
I just…

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.168
I don't know.

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:37.670
Ever since I was little,

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.505
I was on the run.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.051
From the past…

00:05:45.136 --> 00:05:46.220
and my mom.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.975
I was always terrified of being found out.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.021
I wondered if that would be
my life forever.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:00.568
I guess I eventually grew tired of it.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.530
At first, I joined…

00:06:06.574 --> 00:06:07.950
this investigation team

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:10.787
because my mom requested it.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:14.290
But I think a part of me

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:17.335
wanted to see if I could do it.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.632
This time, I really wanted

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:26.969
to stand my ground and fight back.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.846
But in the end,

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.015
it looks like I ran away again.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.018
Ran away from what?

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.526
Carrying out an investigation
is a bit like…

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:45.279
looking after a child.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.116
The more you obsess over it,

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:50.535
the more things go awry.

00:06:53.913 --> 00:06:55.456
What does that mean?

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:59.210
I quit the investigation.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:21.107
Nothing has changed.

00:07:23.025 --> 00:07:24.277
You are still the one

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:27.613
I chose after long, careful observation.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:30.908
You didn't run away.

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:33.494
Just look at this view.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.456
You ended up somewhere even better.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.297
I'm sorry…

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:47.925
I'm just sorry.

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.387
It's okay.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.224
Come here.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:56.767
Hey, buddy!

00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.562
- Run!
- Let's go.

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.815
Ah-ra actually hates dogs.

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:05.485
She's just putting on an act for our sake.

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:07.695
Got you.

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:10.948
Hey, guys.

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:14.702
Isn't it so cute?

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.787
Look at it chasing after me.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.085
Ah-ra.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.879
Wake up. We've arrived.

00:08:25.505 --> 00:08:26.672
Jung-yeon.

00:08:26.756 --> 00:08:29.509
Can't you be nice and wipe her mouth?

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:32.929
I didn't drool.

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:37.183
You guys are terrible.

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.977
I'm going home now.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.396
- Be careful getting out.
- Okay.

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.943
- I'll see you up there.
- Okay.

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.698
I'm going to go and grab my stuff.
It won't take long.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.325
Take your time.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.583
- Hello?
- Why are you so hard to reach?

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.377
You were right.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.421
We have an address
for the doctor you were looking for.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.715
It appears Kang and he were
aware of each other.

00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.801
The perp will be caught soon.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:12.927
No.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:16.847
The doctor's computer and files
were all stolen from his home.

00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:19.058
It appears the perp
was in a real rush this time.

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:21.769
No mirrors or the usual traces.

00:09:21.852 --> 00:09:24.814
The scene was a complete mess.
Return to the office now.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.066
Jeong I-shin won't cooperate
without you here.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:31.195
Jeong I-shin and I will be of no help now.

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:34.991
The perp should be calling soon.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:36.367
We must uncover a lead then.

00:09:38.452 --> 00:09:41.831
Son Hyeon-ho died because of me.

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:45.001
So did Min-jae.

00:09:46.377 --> 00:09:49.380
It's only natural that the team
doesn't want me to be there.

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:51.257
I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.217
Su-yeol.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.344
The issue with the team members

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.224
will be taken care of by Jeong I-shin.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:02.059
What?

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.561
Return to the office immediately

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.605
if you want the perp to be caught.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.528
You need to go, right?

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:14.947
Well…

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.533
Go. I'll be fine.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.163
Jung-yeon.

00:10:22.246 --> 00:10:23.289
Su-yeol.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:26.292
You said the investigation
was like a child.

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:31.172
You can't just pick and choose
when you want to take care of a child.

00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:37.219
Go.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:39.930
Go and make sure
to catch that copycat killer.

00:10:42.642 --> 00:10:44.560
And then, come and pick me up.

00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:42.618
The perp is excited right now.

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:49.291
She's trying to clean up her tracks.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:57.091
Captain Cha Su-yeol
has been relieved from this case.

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:05.182
You can just return to prison
if you're not going to cooperate.

00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:07.101
I will.

00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:08.352
See to it.

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:12.481
Why does it need to be your son?

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.526
After over 20 years
of no contact, why now?

00:12:30.624 --> 00:12:33.669
Can you give us the room for a moment?

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:38.215
We'll be fine.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:07.203
Your custody battle.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:12.208
The child was young,
and with his disability on top of it,

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.794
it was a guaranteed win for the mother.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:17.713
How do you know about that?

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:20.925
That district office punk.

00:13:22.259 --> 00:13:24.970
He just babbled on and on, unprompted.

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:29.141
Why did you lose that custody battle?

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:31.977
Ho-jun, it's okay.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:33.479
You don't have to answer
any more questions.

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:35.356
It's okay. Don't worry, Ho-jun.

00:13:35.439 --> 00:13:37.149
Come on now, Ho-jun.

00:13:39.777 --> 00:13:42.279
Ho-jun. It's okay.

00:13:43.197 --> 00:13:44.949
You don't need to answer that.
You're okay.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.201
Daddy is sorry.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:50.037
He chose his dad.

00:13:52.373 --> 00:13:54.542
The wishes of a child that young

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:57.419
wouldn't influence the judgment.

00:13:57.503 --> 00:13:58.504
You know that.

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:03.634
Daddy.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.928
Daddy.

00:14:08.138 --> 00:14:09.974
- Daddy.
- "Daddy"?

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:13.102
- Daddy.
- It's okay.

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.980
- Daddy.
- I got you.

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.400
Until then, he only knew
how to cry and scream,

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:24.029
and laugh when he was happy.
He had yet to speak a single word.

00:14:25.072 --> 00:14:26.949
But he said, "Daddy" out loud.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:29.952
That was his first word ever.

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:37.251
You pushed for the question to be asked
when you knew it would work against you.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:45.968
You wanted the kid to choose his dad.

00:14:48.512 --> 00:14:50.431
He was too much for you to handle.

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.142
But when that became the reality,

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.227
you found yourself unbearably loathsome.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.980
You became the mother
who abandoned her own child.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.190
Ms. Jeong I-shin.

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:04.194
My son, Inspector Cha Su-yeol,

00:15:05.112 --> 00:15:08.532
became a police officer to prove
that he was nothing like me,

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.367
and that's why he took on this case.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.995
If he can't solve this case,

00:15:13.078 --> 00:15:15.164
he won't be able to forgive himself.

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:17.416
That's why he put up
with his loathsome mother

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:19.168
and refused to ring the emergency alarm.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.503
He wanted to catch the perp.

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:27.885
But all you have is work.

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:30.137
After abandoning your child,

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.265
if you can't even work,
you'll truly be nothing.

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:36.143
I'm sure you can't forgive yourself.

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:37.269
Am I wrong?

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.064
What are you trying to say exactly?

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:41.565
Bring me Su-yeol right now.

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:44.318
He is just as desperate as you.

00:15:45.402 --> 00:15:47.237
Go and see what
unified desperation gets you.

00:15:56.288 --> 00:15:57.414
Inspector Cha Su-yeol…

00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.001
is a decent police officer.

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.421
He is indeed qualified
to be the squad leader of our team.

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.716
We are not refusing him
because he's your son.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.677
It's because he hid that fact from us.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.347
Because he didn't trust us. That's why.

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:15.724
You're right.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.811
Yeah, I was a coward.

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:20.813
I gave him up.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.775
I didn't think I could do it.

00:16:26.568 --> 00:16:29.363
If I couldn't be a good mother for Ho-jun…

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:35.244
I decided I should at least excel
in a space where I'm useful.

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:38.706
But you know what?

00:16:40.124 --> 00:16:41.667
At the very least,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.795
I didn't embrace my child
with hands that butchered human lives.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:47.965
If you possessed any maternal love,
I mean…

00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:50.467
any sense of responsibility,

00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:53.262
shouldn't you have stopped
for your child's sake?

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:57.141
You severed a man's tongue
and ripped off the neck of another.

00:16:57.808 --> 00:16:58.934
What went through your mind

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:01.603
when you went back home
and saw your child?

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.356
"Since I am your mother,

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.151
I won't kill you." Was that it?

00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:09.570
Such an eloquent speaker you are.

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:12.281
You seem quite upset.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.782
I'm just curious.

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:17.286
Are you actually assisting in this case

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.956
for the sake of Cha Su-yeol, your son?

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:24.251
What?

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:26.045
I just can't believe it.

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:30.466
What if this isn't a narrative
about a mother aiding her son?

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:33.510
What if it's one where the mother
is using her son with sinister intentions?

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.764
That's what heinous criminals do.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.560
If that's the case…

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.565
I will kill you.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.034
Inspector Kim Na-hee.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.791
Hang in there.

00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:27.564
NAMBU METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:34.988
You should've gone easy with the cilantro.

00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:36.865
That was just way too much.

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:39.118
The soup was good,
but just too much cilantro…

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.161
Hyuk.

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:06.436
Lying to us was wrong.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.707
Why do you look so blue?

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:31.003
I thought you worked it out
with Su-yeol at the funeral yesterday.

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:34.089
I'm not sure.

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:38.093
I can't figure you two out either.

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:41.763
I do appreciate the reminder
that being single is

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:42.973
the golden ticket.

00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:46.185
How about some day-drinking?

00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.021
Ah-ra.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.732
I can't drink anymore.

00:19:52.482 --> 00:19:53.525
Why not?

00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:56.528
What's wrong?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.282
You can talk to me.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.128
PREGNANT

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.213
Seriously?

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:15.881
Wait, is this thing real?

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:18.467
Congratulations, Jung-yeon!

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.219
This is happy news. What's wrong?

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.347
Don't tell me.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.806
Does Su-yeol not want it?

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.268
Cha Su-yeol, that jerk.
Should I give him a stern talking-to?

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:29.853
Knock some sense into him?

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:31.855
- Should I?
- No. He doesn't know yet.

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:34.900
Why not? Why didn't you tell him?

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:39.529
Jung-yeon.

00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:43.116
I don't know.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.036
I was the one who asked him out
and proposed to him.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:49.164
I'm having this baby,
whether he wants it or not.

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.874
I need to show him how great

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:52.876
having a family can be.

00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:57.005
I'm jealous.

00:20:58.882 --> 00:20:59.967
What?

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:02.135
It's nothing.

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.471
How about going for a drive?

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:20.696
Its name is Astro Jian.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.365
It's a character Sergeant Son made.

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:34.293
I'm not here for a warm welcome.

00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:38.964
But still, at least,
until the investigation is over--

00:21:39.047 --> 00:21:40.299
We need to work together.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.843
We need to catch the culprit.

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:44.428
We can't have any more victims.

00:21:47.764 --> 00:21:48.890
Thank you.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:52.477
Do you remember what you told us
when you first got here?

00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:55.355
It doesn't matter
if it's Narcotics or Major Crimes.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:57.899
A true officer proves themselves
in investigations.

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:01.403
Now, prove yourself.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:03.947
We will respond accordingly.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:19.629
BLOCKED NUMBER

00:22:21.298 --> 00:22:24.259
Why are you in cahoots with the pigs?
Is it for your son's sake?

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:25.927
Do you know what I'm looking at?

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:28.805
A corpse in a bathtub.

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:31.224
What a dumpster fire.

00:22:31.725 --> 00:22:33.810
You didn't kill someone
who deserved to be killed.

00:22:33.894 --> 00:22:37.064
You just did it to save your own ass
because he knew your true identity.

00:22:37.939 --> 00:22:39.191
Do you understand now?

00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:41.485
You and I are nothing alike.

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:44.529
You kill people
just because you want to kill.

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.907
Reasoning is nowhere to be found.

00:22:47.824 --> 00:22:51.286
I know you killed the cat you showed me
when you were a kid.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:54.122
After being abused by your daddy,

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:56.458
you vented your rage on small,
powerless creatures.

00:22:56.541 --> 00:22:59.169
Yeon-joong, that is who you are.

00:22:59.252 --> 00:23:00.629
If you ever have a kid,

00:23:01.713 --> 00:23:03.924
I'm sure you'll follow right
in your daddy's footsteps

00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:05.217
and make your kid suffer.

00:23:06.176 --> 00:23:09.513
You'd better shut up
before I wrench that tongue out.

00:23:09.596 --> 00:23:13.183
Damn, look at those murderous sparks
flying between them.

00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:14.434
Listen, Jeong I-shin,

00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:17.896
you should've just killed me
after killing my dad.

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:21.066
You act all high and mighty
as if you're some noble hero,

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:24.361
but you're nothing more
than the pathetic beast who failed.

00:23:24.444 --> 00:23:26.446
You ought to be grateful to me.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.950
Hey, I was the one who stopped
Park Min-jae from digging into

00:23:30.033 --> 00:23:31.243
you and your son.

00:23:31.326 --> 00:23:35.288
Your son gets to live his happy life now
all because of me.

00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:37.332
And this is the thanks I get?

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.292
What's this now?

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:46.383
Fine. I'll make sure you regret
not killing me after my dad.

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:47.968
You're in prison,

00:23:48.552 --> 00:23:50.053
and I'm out here.

00:23:50.137 --> 00:23:51.304
You just wait and see.

00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:54.933
See how I tear down
every little thing you hold dear.

00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:06.903
She said you were happy because of her.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:12.242
How did you meet Jung-yeon?

00:24:25.297 --> 00:24:28.091
I thought all detectives were scary.

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:31.136
Yeah, I'm really scary.

00:24:33.513 --> 00:24:36.183
What I mean is,

00:24:36.266 --> 00:24:39.060
when I'm working,
I tend to be quite ruthless.

00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:44.316
I hope to see the day
when you become afraid of me.

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:45.609
Why?

00:24:45.692 --> 00:24:49.988
It's just a bit scary to realize
you have feelings for somebody.

00:24:52.824 --> 00:24:55.410
Why are there so many people
in the bathroom?

00:24:57.037 --> 00:25:01.166
What's this? The matchmaker returns from
the bathroom to find a whole new vibe?

00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:05.128
This is only the first meeting,
and you already have secrets?

00:25:25.774 --> 00:25:26.983
POWER OFF

00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:49.506
Hey, don't you worry about a thing.

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:51.591
Safe driving is the best driving.

00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:00.433
The phone is switched off…

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.856
The phone is switched off. Your call
will now be forwarded to voicemail…

00:26:08.191 --> 00:26:09.234
Sir.

00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:11.528
No one's here.

00:26:11.611 --> 00:26:12.612
Her car's gone too.

00:26:12.696 --> 00:26:15.865
- It seems they went somewhere.
- Isn't she an acquaintance?

00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.242
Any idea where she could be?

00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:21.496
Damn it.

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:23.581
Hey, you call that driving?

00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:33.675
The vehicle just passed
Yeoseung Toll Gate.

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:35.969
Yeoseung? Where could they be headed?

00:26:36.052 --> 00:26:38.305
- What about Ms. Lee's phone?
- It's still off.

00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:41.308
The phone is switched off. Your call
will now be forwarded to voicemail…

00:26:42.058 --> 00:26:45.437
Patrol cars and the highway control center
have been notified.

00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:48.189
Most patrol cars are
smart vehicles nowadays.

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:49.774
I'm sure they'll find them.

00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:50.900
Don't worry too much.

00:26:54.154 --> 00:26:56.656
IF YOU'RE WITH AH-RA,
YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HER NOW

00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:03.204
MYEONGCHEON SELF-SERVICE GAS STATION

00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:14.591
Parked.

00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:18.678
So? Can you trust my driving skills now?

00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:20.764
Maybe we can call for a driver?

00:27:20.847 --> 00:27:23.391
No, I got this. No worries.

00:27:25.018 --> 00:27:26.644
- I need to pump the gas.
- Okay.

00:27:38.239 --> 00:27:39.366
Why is it off?

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:44.871
Please select your fuel type.

00:27:50.543 --> 00:27:52.295
HUBBY SU-YEOL

00:27:55.006 --> 00:27:57.634
IF YOU'RE WITH AH-RA,
YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HER NOW

00:27:58.426 --> 00:28:01.221
Ms. Lee's phone was turned on.
She's near Ichang-myeon.

00:28:01.304 --> 00:28:03.473
Send all available units in the area.

00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:05.975
AH-RA IS MIN-JAE'S KILLER…
YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE

00:28:09.562 --> 00:28:11.898
Pass Ichang-myeon and take Route 92.

00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:12.982
Yes, sir.

00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:25.120
What's wrong?

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:30.083
I just need to use the bathroom.

00:28:44.681 --> 00:28:46.850
- All patrol cars in the area--
- Hold on.

00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:49.519
- Su-yeol, it's me.
- Listen, Jung-yeon.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.106
I'll explain the details later.

00:28:53.189 --> 00:28:55.734
If you're with Ah-ra, you need
to get away as soon as possible,

00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:56.860
and find other people.

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.028
And don't panic. I'm on my way.

00:28:59.112 --> 00:29:00.655
Can you tell me where you are?

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.869
Myeongcheon Self-Service Gas Station.

00:29:06.703 --> 00:29:10.999
Jung-yeon, don't hang up,
and just keep your phone on you.

00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:14.586
- Okay.
- Don't get scared. Remain calm.

00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:16.129
Go somewhere with lots of people.

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:17.922
Don't ever turn off your phone.

00:29:18.006 --> 00:29:19.007
Okay, Jung-yeon?

00:29:46.242 --> 00:29:48.995
Our Jung-yeon can be so cute sometimes.

00:30:09.724 --> 00:30:12.769
GISEUNG LOGISTICS

00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:33.122
Hello?

00:30:33.206 --> 00:30:34.332
Is anyone here?

00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:42.131
Su-yeol, I managed to get away.

00:30:42.757 --> 00:30:44.509
Good job, Jung-yeon. Are you okay?

00:30:44.592 --> 00:30:46.344
What is going on right now?

00:30:46.427 --> 00:30:48.096
Is Ah-ra really the culprit?

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.181
It seems so.

00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:52.559
Don't worry. The police are
on their way there. I am too.

00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:55.144
Can you tell me exactly where you are?

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:57.397
I am…

00:30:58.189 --> 00:31:00.316
- at Giseung Logistics.
- Giseung Logistics.

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:05.238
But there's no one else around.

00:31:05.321 --> 00:31:06.906
The police are on their way there.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:08.658
I'm on my way there, too. Don't worry.

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.081
Take a deep breath.

00:31:16.583 --> 00:31:17.584
One,

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:19.377
two,

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.796
three.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.132
One, two,

00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:26.676
three.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.142
Su-yeol, I think someone's here.

00:31:38.187 --> 00:31:39.314
Ms. Lee Jung-yeon?

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.065
Ms. Lee Jung-yeon?

00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.901
Are you here, Ms. Lee?

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:45.361
It's the police.

00:31:47.363 --> 00:31:48.865
I'm over here!

00:31:48.948 --> 00:31:50.283
We've located Ms. Lee.

00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.120
- Do you want to…
- Yes.

00:31:54.203 --> 00:31:55.580
Hello, sir. I'm here.

00:31:55.663 --> 00:31:56.748
Thank you so much.

00:31:56.831 --> 00:31:59.417
Let's first get her somewhere safe.

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:01.753
We'll be there shortly.

00:32:01.836 --> 00:32:02.921
Yes, sir.

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:05.465
You can get in the back.

00:32:06.382 --> 00:32:07.926
We'll get you somewhere safe.

00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:11.220
Heading to the precinct now.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:20.521
Hello?

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.981
Jung-yeon, what's wrong?

00:32:26.527 --> 00:32:27.528
Jung-yeon!

00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:30.323
- Go! Step on it!
- Yes, sir.

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:37.372
Do you copy?

00:32:38.373 --> 00:32:39.374
What's going on there?

00:32:40.959 --> 00:32:42.001
Do you copy?

00:32:42.085 --> 00:32:43.419
Jung-yeon.

00:32:49.384 --> 00:32:50.510
Ah-ra.

00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:51.594
Please don't do this.

00:32:52.178 --> 00:32:53.930
I'm pregnant.

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:57.517
Hello.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.726
It's nice to meet you.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.770
I'm Kang Yeon-joong.

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.555
His gun is missing.

00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:36.639
Sir.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.484
Hello?

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:49.777
Hello?

00:33:49.861 --> 00:33:50.987
Is that you, Su-yeol?

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.369
Ah-ra, you…

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.414
Inspector Cha Su-yeol.

00:34:01.497 --> 00:34:03.666
No, I mean Jeong-ho.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.751
It's been a while.

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:06.335
Kang Yeon-joong.

00:34:08.046 --> 00:34:10.298
Jung-yeon is taking a nice little nap.

00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:14.135
The only thing she has to look forward to
when she wakes up is hell.

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:16.095
I hope she at least has a nice dream.

00:34:17.096 --> 00:34:19.015
Lay a hand on her,
and you'll answer to me.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.809
Su-yeol.

00:34:21.893 --> 00:34:24.562
She was just a toy
I threw your way from the start.

00:34:24.645 --> 00:34:26.481
Who are you to threaten me?

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.399
Oh, that's right.

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:30.526
I left a little gift for you there.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.528
Check the center console.

00:35:31.462 --> 00:35:33.381
NAMBU METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.677
I've located the suspect's vehicle.
It's headed toward…

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.053
YEONPO INTERSECTION, ROUTE 21

00:35:39.137 --> 00:35:41.806
Su-yeol, it looks like the perp
is heading to Woongsan.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.642
- She's not hiding it either.
- Wait…

00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:48.104
Kang Yeon-joong's old house in Tangwang
and my old house.

00:35:48.187 --> 00:35:50.857
Dispatch units to every place
of interest tied to the perp.

00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:53.359
And Yeonpo Bridge
also needs to be sealed off.

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.290
Sir.

00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:11.169
After the Hyupseong mines shut down,
everyone moved out of the company housing.

00:36:11.252 --> 00:36:14.672
There's no one
at your old house in Yeonpo either.

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:18.843
And Yeonpo Bridge?

00:36:18.926 --> 00:36:21.554
It was sealed off a while ago.
They never crossed it.

00:36:21.637 --> 00:36:24.098
It seems they're somewhere in this town.

00:36:25.975 --> 00:36:27.852
The mining company has been contacted.

00:36:28.769 --> 00:36:31.564
The advance SOU units are gathered
at the community center.

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:33.524
We should head there.

00:36:51.125 --> 00:36:52.126
You're awake.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:53.711
What do you think?

00:36:54.503 --> 00:36:55.546
Isn't it cozy?

00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:58.299
It's my favorite spot.

00:36:58.925 --> 00:37:00.551
I wonder if you'll like it too.

00:37:00.635 --> 00:37:01.719
Ah-ra.

00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:03.429
It's me, Jung-yeon.

00:37:05.014 --> 00:37:07.225
Of course, I know you, Jung-yeon.

00:37:07.308 --> 00:37:09.685
You're Cha Su-yeol's wife
and Jeong I-shin's daughter-in-law.

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:12.230
I was the one who introduced you to him.

00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:14.106
If I'm being honest,

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:16.692
I tried a few other girls
with him before you.

00:37:16.776 --> 00:37:19.153
But for some odd reason,
he only ever showed interest in you.

00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:21.697
I knew the door code to your place.

00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.532
I got daily updates
on Cha Su-yeol from you.

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:24.742
I even saw him every day.

00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:27.119
I didn't even need CCTV or surveillance.

00:37:27.662 --> 00:37:28.663
All thanks to you.

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.039
Why are you doing this?

00:37:31.624 --> 00:37:33.542
She looked after me.

00:37:33.626 --> 00:37:36.462
It's only right that I help out her son,
don't you think?

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.049
"Her"?

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:42.969
Hey.

00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:47.807
Unbelievable.
You really need to get your shit together.

00:37:49.392 --> 00:37:51.560
You might see your mother-in-law.

00:37:51.644 --> 00:37:53.396
You can't be out of it already.

00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:09.996
LEADING COAL INDUSTRY INNOVATION!
EAST MINE SHAFT

00:38:20.715 --> 00:38:21.757
Sir.

00:38:21.841 --> 00:38:22.842
Thanks.

00:38:23.342 --> 00:38:24.343
Hold on.

00:38:27.847 --> 00:38:28.848
Yes, sir?

00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:35.104
Answer it.

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.781
Hi! Keep your mouth shut and listen to me.

00:38:46.532 --> 00:38:47.908
You must be wondering where I am.

00:38:49.285 --> 00:38:50.494
You could call it my hideout.

00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:53.122
There are a lot of bugs here
and it's quite damp,

00:38:53.205 --> 00:38:54.790
but I love it.

00:38:55.458 --> 00:38:57.710
- Basement storage room.
- Every time my dad got wasted

00:38:57.793 --> 00:38:59.295
and flipped out, I'd hide here.

00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:04.383
Ta-da!

00:39:05.259 --> 00:39:08.179
I used to play doctor on this table.

00:39:08.262 --> 00:39:10.681
I used to pretend
the box cutter was a scalpel,

00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.642
and I used it to slice open
stray cats and dogs, one after another.

00:39:14.769 --> 00:39:15.811
You were right.

00:39:15.895 --> 00:39:17.855
The cat I showed you back then

00:39:17.938 --> 00:39:19.315
was also killed by me.

00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:23.819
I just sort of felt this thrill
when I went against my dad's wishes.

00:39:23.903 --> 00:39:25.946
You know what I'm talking about, right?

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.658
At some point, he was no longer a factor.
I just wanted to keep doing it.

00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:32.119
I started small
and eventually made my way up.

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:35.164
From beasts to people.

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:38.876
Fuck, seriously…

00:39:41.962 --> 00:39:44.215
I should've been
the one to kill my father.

00:39:48.969 --> 00:39:50.513
I really fucking regret that.

00:39:58.104 --> 00:39:59.772
I've always wanted

00:39:59.855 --> 00:40:02.316
to slice open a pregnant creature.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:04.318
I wondered

00:40:04.402 --> 00:40:06.904
- Sir.
- if you put the mother under anesthesia,

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:08.489
does the baby go under too?

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.449
Aren't you dying to know too?

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.036
So I went all over town looking for one,

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:17.915
but I couldn't find
a single pregnant bitch around.

00:40:17.998 --> 00:40:19.417
Maybe my town was too rural?

00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:22.962
I've sliced through everything else,

00:40:24.171 --> 00:40:25.297
but not that yet.

00:40:27.383 --> 00:40:29.927
I feel like I'll be able
to check that off my list today.

00:40:31.137 --> 00:40:32.471
Are you still a child?

00:40:35.224 --> 00:40:37.059
You took out your rage at your daddy

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.854
on helpless animals.

00:40:39.937 --> 00:40:41.981
Because you were weak back then.

00:40:49.572 --> 00:40:50.781
But that's no longer the case.

00:40:52.324 --> 00:40:54.285
If you're mad at me, take it out on me.

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:57.079
You want me, right?

00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.374
And not the toy you found.

00:41:01.834 --> 00:41:03.043
Hey, Jung-yeon.

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:06.088
Your mother-in-law
just called you a "toy."

00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:14.680
I'm sure I told you
to keep your mouth shut.

00:41:18.476 --> 00:41:20.227
Our Jung-yeon…

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.358
gets to live, thanks to her mother-in-law.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.361
I'll give her back,

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:30.446
but in exchange,

00:41:30.529 --> 00:41:32.114
you come here in person.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.951
The exchange will happen in five hours,
at the community center.

00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:37.036
And after that…

00:41:37.828 --> 00:41:39.205
I'll tell you when you get here.

00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:43.292
If I even detect a whiff of the police,

00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:46.295
I'll just kill Jung-yeon.

00:41:47.463 --> 00:41:48.547
See you later.

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:49.632
Mom.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.384
Five hours later?

00:41:52.468 --> 00:41:53.844
It'll be 11:00 a.m.

00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:55.638
Jeong I-shin is coming here?

00:42:29.672 --> 00:42:31.006
Open your mouth.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.093
Stop acting like you give a damn about me.
Untie me now.

00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:36.053
It looks like

00:42:37.346 --> 00:42:39.682
our Jung-yeon is not ready
to become a mom yet.

00:42:40.432 --> 00:42:43.018
Forget you. Will your baby be okay?

00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.365
Have you lost your mind?

00:42:57.157 --> 00:43:00.286
Hey! I went out of my way to help you.

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:02.329
Why the hell would you spit on my face?

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:04.248
Look at what you did. I'm filthy now!

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.879
INSPECTOR CHA SU-YEOL

00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:12.298
SPEAKER

00:43:12.881 --> 00:43:15.217
You will end up dead if you go there.
You know that.

00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:16.302
Just accept it.

00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.305
You hand over one to get back two.

00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:20.931
It's a pretty good deal.

00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.476
Last time, you told me

00:43:26.186 --> 00:43:27.730
I should aid with the investigation

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.773
if I want to pay for my sins.

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:32.443
It's quite amusing.

00:43:35.154 --> 00:43:36.447
I am a death row inmate.

00:43:38.073 --> 00:43:40.618
Even when I killed the scum of the earth
who deserved to die,

00:43:41.201 --> 00:43:42.703
I was tried in a court of law.

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:47.833
However, when it comes to you…

00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:52.254
What about me?

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.221
I have to do this.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.852
INSPECTOR CHA SU-YEOL

00:44:11.106 --> 00:44:12.149
I understand…

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.444
but I can't make that decision.

00:44:19.782 --> 00:44:21.158
After the mines shut down,

00:44:21.241 --> 00:44:23.160
there was talk of a casino coming in,

00:44:23.744 --> 00:44:24.953
but I guess it went nowhere.

00:44:25.537 --> 00:44:27.164
Even the former miners say

00:44:27.247 --> 00:44:29.124
that there isn't anyone who knows

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:30.918
all the ins and outs of the mines.

00:44:31.418 --> 00:44:33.003
Damn it. So what now?

00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:36.674
After mobilizing all this man power,
are we just supposed to sit on our hands?

00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:39.635
They said not to provoke the perp.
Just do as you're told.

00:44:39.718 --> 00:44:40.761
What about Captain Cha?

00:44:47.434 --> 00:44:48.936
His mother, wife,

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.062
and now, even his baby.

00:44:50.562 --> 00:44:52.773
I would've lost my mind already.

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:55.651
You are just impossibly naive.

00:44:57.319 --> 00:44:58.404
What does that mean?

00:44:59.321 --> 00:45:00.364
I mean…

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.034
This might sound a bit…

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:08.205
Damn it. Screw it.

00:45:08.956 --> 00:45:11.250
Anyhow, if we solely rely on Kang's words,

00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:15.003
and things go awry,
we might end up letting Kang and Jeong,

00:45:15.087 --> 00:45:17.214
both of the bloodthirsty killers,
walk free.

00:45:18.006 --> 00:45:19.299
What if they're in it together?

00:45:21.802 --> 00:45:24.179
To be honest,
I don't trust the captain either.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.560
After all we've been through,
that's what you think about Captain Cha?

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.813
From what I've seen,

00:45:32.896 --> 00:45:35.149
he has worked harder than anyone
to catch this perp.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.734
He suffered the most
every time there was a new victim.

00:45:37.818 --> 00:45:39.111
She's right.

00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:41.738
It was almost to the point
of being excessive.

00:45:41.822 --> 00:45:43.157
I finally understand now.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.159
Jeong I-shin said that Captain Cha

00:45:45.742 --> 00:45:47.744
became a police officer
and took on this case

00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:50.080
to prove that he was
nothing like his mother.

00:45:50.164 --> 00:45:51.999
To prove that he wasn't like her?

00:45:52.082 --> 00:45:55.711
In other words, to prove he's someone
who saves lives, not takes them.

00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:59.089
Someone who rescues lives
and prevents crime.

00:45:59.173 --> 00:46:02.217
I'm sure seeing the climbing number
of victims drove him insane.

00:46:02.301 --> 00:46:04.887
He probably believed
he failed to stop the murders.

00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:09.099
And to make matters worse,
the killer was imitating his mother.

00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:12.853
He was practically forced
to relive his mother's traumatizing past.

00:46:13.687 --> 00:46:15.105
It must have been

00:46:16.482 --> 00:46:18.650
so painful for him.

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:19.902
And you suggest

00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:23.155
he would use his pregnant wife
to help out Kang and Jeong?

00:46:25.157 --> 00:46:26.867
No, what I meant was…

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:28.118
Captain Cha is not involved.

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.330
If anything, he's getting used
by the two of them.

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:36.418
But what if Jeong I-shin
was exploiting such intentions?

00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:40.881
As if serial murder wasn't enough,
what if she was using her son

00:46:40.964 --> 00:46:43.717
to make her escape?

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.304
His life will be…

00:46:47.387 --> 00:46:50.307
That's why we need
to keep it together for his sake.

00:46:51.725 --> 00:46:52.893
Let's see what happens.

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.103
A hostage exchange?

00:46:56.855 --> 00:46:58.524
The higher-ups would never agree to that.

00:46:59.441 --> 00:47:00.442
You said it yourself.

00:47:00.526 --> 00:47:03.153
The commissioner would never take on
such a risk that might result

00:47:03.237 --> 00:47:04.821
in two serial killers walking free.

00:47:12.037 --> 00:47:13.038
Chief Choi.

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:15.666
Jung-ho.

00:47:15.749 --> 00:47:16.833
Have you lost your mind?

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:19.294
How could we ever trust
Jeong I-shin enough to release her?

00:47:19.378 --> 00:47:21.296
We'll have her wear a tracker

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.423
and catch her when she's with the perp.

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.634
This is actually our chance
to catch the perp as well.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.512
Jeong I-shin has agreed to cooperate.

00:47:28.595 --> 00:47:29.888
What if they're in it together?

00:47:29.972 --> 00:47:31.348
What if they're accomplices?

00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:33.308
What if this isn't
a chance to catch criminals,

00:47:33.392 --> 00:47:35.811
but for the Mantis to make her escape?

00:47:35.894 --> 00:47:36.979
Just in case,

00:47:38.355 --> 00:47:40.649
we'll secure the perimeter
of the exchange site.

00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:44.319
We will take every precaution
to prevent escape.

00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:48.115
We don't have time.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.493
If the police knew of
a pregnant hostage and she's murdered,

00:47:52.327 --> 00:47:53.704
how will you handle the backlash?

00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:57.708
We have a little more
than four hours left.

00:47:57.791 --> 00:48:00.627
We need to take
Jeong I-shin to the site now.

00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:04.631
We never should've brought
that woman into this to begin with!

00:48:10.262 --> 00:48:11.638
Jung-ho, you're done.

00:48:12.347 --> 00:48:14.683
I'll take over the reins from here.

00:48:17.185 --> 00:48:18.437
I refuse.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:19.938
What did you say?

00:48:20.522 --> 00:48:21.898
I will see this through.

00:48:29.406 --> 00:48:32.034
We received a report of a child screaming.

00:48:32.618 --> 00:48:34.328
May I take a look inside?

00:48:35.537 --> 00:48:37.289
Are you going to take him and raise him?

00:48:38.373 --> 00:48:40.250
Sir, there's no need for all that.

00:48:42.961 --> 00:48:44.254
You know about Kang Yeon-joong.

00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:46.923
That day,

00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:50.344
if I had forced myself in there…

00:48:53.513 --> 00:48:55.557
I would've discovered Kang,

00:48:56.183 --> 00:48:58.310
and if I had taken
the necessary measures back then,

00:48:58.393 --> 00:49:01.772
his father wouldn't have been
murdered either.

00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:07.069
Then, Kang would've never witnessed
Jeong I-shin murder his father.

00:49:07.152 --> 00:49:08.528
And 23 years later,

00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:11.114
we could've avoided

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:13.950
Kang following in Jeong's footsteps
and killing all those people.

00:49:17.871 --> 00:49:19.373
What has gotten into you?

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:20.874
You know what that town was like.

00:49:21.541 --> 00:49:23.460
Half of them didn't want
the mines shut down,

00:49:24.711 --> 00:49:27.964
while the other half demanded it
and called for the casino to be built.

00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:30.801
Every day, they got drunk
and beat each other up.

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.303
It was a complete mess.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.681
Out in the open, on the street,

00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:38.558
and even in front of our precinct,
they pummeled each other.

00:49:39.226 --> 00:49:41.061
They beat each other to a bloody pulp.

00:49:41.728 --> 00:49:44.606
Him beating his child
inside his home wasn't--

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:46.108
Excuses!

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.405
Those are all just excuses.

00:49:52.614 --> 00:49:55.409
At the end of the day,
we failed to fulfill our duties.

00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:57.869
What we couldn't do back then…

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.417
Now,

00:50:04.876 --> 00:50:06.628
I would like to see it through myself.

00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:25.355
You know what the higher-ups
are worried about, right?

00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:28.358
Do they suspect them of being accomplices?

00:50:29.401 --> 00:50:31.027
That Kang Yeon-joong did all this

00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:33.321
to get Jeong I-shin out?

00:50:33.989 --> 00:50:36.908
Jeong I-shin remains a dark chapter
in the history of the police.

00:50:37.951 --> 00:50:40.036
They wouldn't mind
if she just disappeared.

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:56.261
Yes, I understand.

00:51:02.476 --> 00:51:05.395
We'll understand that as your approval
and move accordingly.

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:09.024
It's getting weirder out there.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:11.860
Who was that?

00:51:11.943 --> 00:51:13.695
It's a special order
from the commissioner.

00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:16.281
We'll operate independently going forward.

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.991
Hyuk.

00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:36.468
You tried to save me once.

00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:39.888
Thank you.

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:46.102
But can you tell me

00:51:47.145 --> 00:51:49.898
how it feels when you go out of your way

00:51:49.981 --> 00:51:51.817
to save a person?

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.328
All right. Let's head out.

00:52:08.708 --> 00:52:11.086
Even when I killed the scum of the earth
who deserved to die,

00:52:11.753 --> 00:52:13.380
I was tried in a court of law.

00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:16.258
I have to do this.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.369
Momma Bird is passing Woongsan Elementary.

00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:39.341
WOONGSAN SERIAL HOMICIDE
INVESTIGATION HEADQUARTERS

00:53:42.636 --> 00:53:43.887
You can step out now.

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:11.873
We'll remain on standby here.

00:54:11.957 --> 00:54:14.292
When the hostage exchange commences,

00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:17.045
we'll take our spots here, here, and here,

00:54:17.128 --> 00:54:18.880
to pursue Kang and Jeong.

00:54:18.964 --> 00:54:21.508
But what was the special order
from the commissioner?

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:26.554
"Kang does not need to be arrested alive.
Close this case today, no matter what."

00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:29.057
"Excluding Lee Jung-yeon and Cha Su-yeol,

00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:31.351
don't take extreme measures
for a hostage's safety."

00:54:32.018 --> 00:54:36.064
"For the sake of Lee and Cha's safety,
and for the sake of stopping Kang,

00:54:37.023 --> 00:54:39.234
Jeong I-shin may be shot down."

00:54:39.317 --> 00:54:40.527
That was his order.

00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:43.655
We'll communicate on channel eight.

00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:51.264
Once Jung-yeon is returned…

00:55:53.266 --> 00:55:54.851
we'll pursue you immediately afterward.

00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:03.318
Let me see your arm.

00:56:04.235 --> 00:56:05.236
No need.

00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.156
Kang has a gun.

00:56:10.158 --> 00:56:11.326
So, you must wear this.

00:56:13.078 --> 00:56:14.913
A lot of people want me dead.

00:56:15.538 --> 00:56:16.831
Kang isn't the only one.

00:56:23.129 --> 00:56:24.297
I don't.

00:56:26.049 --> 00:56:27.258
So let me see your arm.

00:56:32.305 --> 00:56:34.057
I'll be nearby.

00:56:35.642 --> 00:56:36.768
Don't worry.

00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:54.994
Walk straight up the mountain
behind Mine Number Two.

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:58.039
Make sure the Mantis is cuffed,
and you make sure you're unarmed.

00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:01.793
If anyone tries to pull a fast one
or if there's any funny business,

00:57:02.627 --> 00:57:05.004
Jung-yeon and your baby
will be killed immediately.

00:57:59.017 --> 00:58:00.018
Are you ready?

00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:19.078
Baby Bird has brought Momma Bird
out of the community center.

00:58:19.162 --> 00:58:20.580
Moving out.

00:58:20.663 --> 00:58:23.166
The Mantis is really here.

00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:43.770
Bae, you head out first.

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:46.356
Move in a wide arc
around the foot of the mountain,

00:58:46.439 --> 00:58:49.359
and scout out buildings or caves
that could be used as a hideout.

00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:51.110
- You got it.
- Stay alert.

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.737
Don't forget the perp has a gun.

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:55.323
Yes, ma'am.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:22.660
{\an8}As soon as the exchange happens,
our units will move in.

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:25.413
{\an8}Take your shot
as soon as Jung-yeon is safe.

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:27.373
{\an8}I was so disappointed.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.209
{\an8}This is your one chance
if you want to kill me.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:33.254
{\an8}Tell me where Jeong I-shin went.

01:00:33.338 --> 01:00:36.049
{\an8}An off-the-record APB
has been issued for you two.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.593
{\an8}Why were you so lenient with her?

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:40.637
{\an8}And with me?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.056
{\an8}That thing burned my mother to death.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:47.018
{\an8}Doesn't it get so lonely?
Living as a monster…

01:00:47.101 --> 01:00:50.563
