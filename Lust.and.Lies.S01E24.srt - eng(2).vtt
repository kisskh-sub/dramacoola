=Lust and Lies=

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:49.840
Tell them to leave.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:51.640
We'll carry on.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.519
Qingwan.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.920
From this day on,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.359
Sucheng

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.159
belongs to just the two of us.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.200
Qingwan?

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.560
To smoke out the spies
you planted around me,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:44.560
I played along with this charade.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.359
Did you enjoy it?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.100
=Episode 24=

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.199
Cheng is back.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:11.000
He told me

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.520
Sheng Weilian tried to kill him.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.159
He caught Sheng Weilian

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.080
betraying the Huofeng Gang.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.560
That means he planted men
in the ranks back then

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.759
to murder Huo Jin.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.039
He used Huo Beishan to wipe out

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.599
the Huofeng Gang,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.360
then lent me soldiers so I could take revenge

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:38.840
and kill...

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.400
He must've known you were Huo Qingwan,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.719
so he set it all up

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.199
to turn us into enemies.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.159
He planned to use you to finish me off

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.759
and the Gu family.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.400
One scheme after another.

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.790
Sucheng would have

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.000
nothing but the Sheng family.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.560
He has people planted deep within

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.319
the Huo Army.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.919
I can't act with that in mind.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.560
Then, I need to stay close.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:18.520
I'll marry him.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.080
After all your scheming,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.280
I was just another piece
on your board, wasn't I?

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.199
You know,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.879
on the chessboard,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.120
there are the king

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.479
and the queen.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:40.360
The place I've always left for you

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.199
is the queen's seat.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.080
I just want us
to win this game together.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.800
Why won't you choose me?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.360
The queen?

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.840
Isn't she the piece

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.439
that can be sacrificed
for the king at any moment?

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.879
But Huo Xiu is not like you.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.360
That's exactly why I chose him.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.399
All right.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.600
Fine.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:20.800
You know,

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:24.079
for the sake of this game...

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.040
I had to sacrifice so many people.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.160
Huo Jin.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.959
Mr. Ruan.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.639
Zhao Xun.

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:40.920
Madam Huo.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.959
The Huofeng Gang.

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:44.360
The Huo Army.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.800
I've lost count at this point!

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.959
Zhao Xun and my mother...

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:53.279
Remember the earrings?

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:57.240
That was my idea.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:01.800
That fool Zhao Xun.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.079
I only said a few words
to instigate him,

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.240
and he actually went to Huo Xiu

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.399
and died for you.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.839
And don't forget your useless mother.

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.000
I had someone slip her poison.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.000
And she actually drank it.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:24.800
Hate me.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.040
Hate me all you want.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.519
Then, you'll never forget me.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:41.759
Want to kill me?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.120
The Shengs won't let it slide.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.519
Then, I'll wipe out the Sheng family.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.680
Kill him.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.120
I am the only one

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.079
who will ever love you.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:24.759
Weilian.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.920
If we can't be husband and wife in life,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.639
then let's be lovers in death.

What went wrong?

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.360
For the sake of revenge,

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.360
so many innocent people have died.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.360
All of this...

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.399
is beyond right or wrong.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.120
We're victims

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:47.800
and the perpetrators.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.040
I once promised the First Madam

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:58.360
I would protect you for life.

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.399
I think

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.279
what she wanted most is for you to live.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:23.199
I've been living down in the cabin,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.399
consumed by this hunger for revenge.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:37.240
Huo Xiu.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.200
I'm going out to see the world.

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.159
All right.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.120
We'll leave Sucheng together.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.960
You still have those men who follow you.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.240
They stayed with you
in Sucheng for 15 years

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.320
for the Gu family's revenge.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.080
You can't abandon them.

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.360
And the people of Sucheng

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.039
still need you to protect them.

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:14.000
I carry too much blood and too many lost souls.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.279
I want to go where I'm needed and atone.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.639
I wish you

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.519
a bright future in Sucheng.

If we ever meet again...

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:57.080
Can we forgo the past?

Only if

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.840
I could atone for all my sins.

Easy, easy.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.159
Thank you.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:27.320
Got it.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.080
Here you go.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.039
Mr. Gu.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:33.200
With your donation,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.720
the people in the disaster area
will get through this.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:37.799
If you need anything,

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:39.000
just let me know.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:42.200
You've always been so charitable.

00:10:42.519 --> 00:10:43.960
You must have helped a lot of people.

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:46.480
All for good karma, right?

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.879
When you give to charity,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.279
what do you pray for?

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:56.000
My wife?

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.559
All she does is pray
and light incense every day.

00:10:58.919 --> 00:10:59.759
She always says

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.519
that if you want something,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.279
you have to do more good deeds
and build up good karma.

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:06.519
But Mr. Gu,

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:07.799
you have everything.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.039
If there's something you want,

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.559
you can get it in a heartbeat.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.919
Yet, there are things beyond my reach.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:16.919
Dr. Huo,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.480
are you really going to the front?

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:19.639
They need me there.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:20.519
I have to go.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:22.320
But it's dangerous out there.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.480
Even if it costs me my life,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.759
I'll must save the people.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:27.559
No.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.519
You have to stay alive.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.600
There is someone
you still want to see, right?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.399
Maybe

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.039
we're not meant to be.
