00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.640
Soldiers from the royal court
came and killed everyone.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.720
They said

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.120
it was an order

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.400
from Somdet Saenyakon.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.640
Once back at the palace,
sound the war drums at once.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.600
This time you must train
seriously for battle.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.400
Start with Jade as the tank,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.160
the front-line fighter.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.240
Your Majesty will be the mage,
supporting from the center.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.039
Banjong will be the carry.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.680
Kosol the assassin.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.160
He must find a way
to take down Somdet.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.600
Have you told Banjong yet?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.720
Told him?

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.560
Told him what?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.840
That the two of us
are lovers now.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.520
And you should tell him
you’ve turned him down.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.120
Not yet.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.760
Then why haven’t you?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.400
What are you waiting for?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.240
I’m just afraid that,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.240
won’t he get confused?

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.640
Because before this,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.800
I once confessed my love to him.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.360
And now suddenly I go and reject him.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.760
I wouldn’t even know what reason to give.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.120
Hearts can change at any time.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.079
It’s nothing strange

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.320
that yesterday you loved,
and today you don’t.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.400
But speaking your feelings honestly

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.920
is what you should do,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.040
instead of holding back

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.400
and making things so gloomy.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.520
That way, Banjong can stop
his hopeless dreams.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.560
But won’t he be hurt?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000
So what if he is?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.160
If he dares to love,
he must dare to be hurt.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.440
And every time I see him
flirt with you, it grates on me.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.400
One day I might not be able to hold back.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.920
I’ll smash his face in
just for being annoying.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.160
Don’t you dare.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.200
When the time and chance come,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.800
I’ll tell him myself.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.920
Give me time to sort out my heart.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.400
And tell me,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.400
how can I be sure you won’t
change your heart for another?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.920
No.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.480
No, what?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.320
You said it yourself,

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.960
that hearts can change anytime.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.720
So how can I be sure

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.520
you’ll love me forever and ever?

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.920
I was talking about people in general.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.079
But I’m not like the rest.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.040
Everyone in this world but me,

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.079
I’ll love you unchangingly.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.600
A guy like you,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.800
saying things like that, huh?

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.480
Can I write that line down?

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.120
I’ll use it to write a new song.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.720
The title will be,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.320
“I’m Not Like Anyone Else.”

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.720
Brother Kosol.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.959
Oh, are you all eating?

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.000
I came right on time.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.720
Mind if I join in?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.440
Whoa!

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.520
Shrimp paste chili dip.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.640
So pungent.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.720
Let’s see what I brought along.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.360
Fermented fish dip.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.080
Smells good.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.400
Looks tasty, doesn’t it?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.640
I made this especially for you,
Brother Kosol.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.040
Oops.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.680
The shrimp paste again.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.440
Ugh, stinky.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.880
Jade, what are you doing?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.640
Why aren’t you asleep yet?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.200
I was waiting for the Count,
my Lord.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.920
Worradej has been staying
at your brother’s quarters.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.720
He hasn’t returned here
for many nights.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.280
And you’re still waiting?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.240
I must wait, my Lord.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.400
In case the Count chooses
to sleep here,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.640
so I can attend to him.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.400
And how long will you wait?

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.240
Once the moon rises high
above the treetops,

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.320
I’ll go to bed, my Lord.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.160
Your Majesty.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.320
Where are you going,
Your Majesty?

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.760
To wait here and keep you company.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.800
Please don’t, my Lord.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.280
You should rest, Your Majesty.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.760
You must spar early
tomorrow morning.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.680
I can wait by myself, my Lord.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.320
Aren’t we training partners?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.159
I sleep when you sleep.

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.360
I wake when you wake.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.640
I’ve told you before, you’re my friend.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.280
And friends should do everything together.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.680
Well then…

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.040
I’ll go to bed, Your Majesty.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.240
Jade.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.040
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600
Come lie here on the bed with me.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.200
Your Majesty…

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.880
I wouldn’t dare, sire.
Ringworm will eat my head.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.640
Ringworm again?

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.360
If the Ringworm eats your head,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.320
I’ll have the royal physician
treat you myself.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.600
Come up.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.120
Your Majesty, I…

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.400
Do you dare defy my command?

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.880
No one escapes royal punishment.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.880
A lowly servant lying on the king’s bed,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.440
that would be truly improper, sire.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.040
Then sleep there, if you must.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.800
But stay and keep me company.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.880
You always fall asleep first.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.720
Don’t you dare fall asleep.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.280
Hey, Jade.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.000
Have you ever had someone you loved?

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.200
Jade.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.200
Falling asleep this fast, really?

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.040
Jade, wake up and answer me,
have you ever loved someone?

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.520
Jade.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.720
Jade.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.240
Jade.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.840
I’m already grown like this,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.120
why have I never loved anyone?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.200
I don’t even know why.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.520
Banjong.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.760
Hm?

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.560
Well…

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.280
that last shot I fired yesterday,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:50.400
I still don’t know if it hit the mark or not.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.960
- Shoot.
- Enough practice for today.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.760
I’ll hold your hand and teach you
until you never miss.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.200
Hmm… still missed.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.840
Just grazed it again.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.040
Really?

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.120
Then I guess,

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.400
I’m not cut out for shooting.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.760
I should do something else.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.640
Don’t want to waste your time.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.280
It’s fine. I’m glad to teach you.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.480
I don’t feel tired at all.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.640
I’ll keep teaching you until you hit true.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.480
Even if it takes a lifetime.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.720
Then maybe…

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.320
I should get glasses first.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.080
The problem might be my eyesight.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.440
Glasses?

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.920
Perfect. You’ll be my partner in crime.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.240
Banjong, you…

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.480
Don’t say that.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.960
I’m shy.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.800
You’re shy because of me?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.240
So that means you feel something for me.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.120
This is a prelude,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.440
to accepting my love, isn’t it?

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.520
Go ahead, say it.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.000
I’m ready to hear it.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.760
Uh…

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.400
Easy now, Banjong.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:16.560
- I…
- I get it.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.640
Accepting someone’s love

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.360
can be hard.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.240
But right now it’s just the two of us.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.840
No need to be shy.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.520
Speaking your feelings honestly matters

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.520
more than holding back

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.000
and leaving things in the air like this.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.400
The truth is…

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.880
I have something to tell you.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.720
Banjong.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.480
I don’t love,

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.120
Banjong.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.760
What’s wrong with you?

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.440
Banjong

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.680
Banjong, Banjong, what’s wrong with you?

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.160
Banjong, Banjong

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.480
Banjong

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.200
Help, somebody help!

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.040
Please, someone help!

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.800
Banjong, Banjong, what’s happening?

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.080
Help!

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.280
Help, somebody help!

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.880
Help, Banjong!

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.800
Help!

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.600
Stay with me!

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.080
Help!

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.480
Help!

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.800
Banjong

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.360
Huh? You’re faking a seizure?

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.200
I didn’t know what else to do.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.320
I just needed to buy myself some time.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.880
So I’d have more time
to prove my feelings to Worradej.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.200
What about you?

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.600
Does Kosol seem to like you back?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.840
Kind of, yeah.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.000
Yesterday Kosol ate the food I made.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.680
He really seemed to enjoy it.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.720
Eat it, please.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.920
Or should I feed you?

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.240
No need, no need.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.720
I’ll eat it myself.

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.040
Is it good?

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.520
Look at his face.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.520
See if he actually wants to eat.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.400
He does. If not, he’d have spat it out.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.360
Right, Kosol?

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.440
See?

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.680
Kosol likes my cooking.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.960
Here, one more bite.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.480
No thanks.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.640
In that case,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.200
you’ll have to cook for Kosol every day.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.640
Don’t ever miss a day.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.240
Your cooking skills

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.520
might make Kosol leave Worradej

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.280
and turn his eyes to you.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.280
Since Worradej can’t cook at all.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.000
As for me,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.240
I’ll keep chasing after Worradej.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.840
Divide and conquer, that’s the plan.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.400
Same target.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.480
Deal?

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.720
And when I hit my goal,

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.200
I’ll find a way to split you from Worradej.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.880
Again.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.280
Harder.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.480
Elbow strike.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.000
Another elbow.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.520
Elbow strike.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.480
- Good.
- Again.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.080
Come on, hit again.

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.440
Harder.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.080
Swing that punch.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.160
Come on.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.720
Hit.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.960
Elbow.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.840
Swing it, kick again.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.240
Kosol.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.560
Here’s some water.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.440
Thanks.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.000
But take it to your brother,
I can scoop some myself.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.640
I mixed sacred drops
in this one just for you.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.400
It’s extra refreshing.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.200
Don’t turn me down.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.520
Here, let me feed you.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.960
Feeling refreshed?

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.000
Worradej.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.920
Are you sore anywhere?

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.280
I can give you a massage.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.520
No, I’m fine. Not sore yet.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.680
If I do get sore, I can handle it myself.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.440
Even if you’re not sore,
a massage won’t hurt.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.120
It’ll help your muscles relax.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.360
I learned massage from Wat Pho, you know.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.920
Somdet’s army is coming.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.200
We’ve got one watch to prepare.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.840
Everyone, to your posts.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.600
Follow the plan we laid out.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.760
Go.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.280
Move, quick.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.320
- Get in.
- Wait.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.600
They’re opening
the city gates to welcome us?

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.080
That looks way too suspicious.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.480
It must be some kind of trap.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.520
When their troops march in,

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.520
we’ll leave our gates wide open

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.200
with not a single guard stationed there.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.680
Are you out of your mind?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.080
How could we just open the gates
and let them in so easily?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.640
Our forces are far fewer.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.960
If we clash head-on at the walls,

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:18.000
we’ll lose men for nothing.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.880
This plan will make them paranoid.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.200
We’ll lure them inside the city.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.040
It’ll be easier to deal with them there.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.040
All of you,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.760
stay alert with every step you take.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.840
This city is riddled with traps.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.120
Is that clear?

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.920
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.560
Here they are, everyone. Come on in!

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.960
- Come on in, come on!
- Come inside!

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.320
Hurry in!

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.680
Count your kids and family carefully.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.600
Pandao, take everyone to hide in that room.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.040
This way, this way.
Grandma, are you okay?

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.040
You okay? Easy now.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.440
Walk slowly.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.960
Search every corner.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.040
Take them all alive
and bring them back as slaves.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.600
If anyone resists, kill them.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.760
The only one to capture alive
is King Chaiyached.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.880
Go on in, Grandma.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.280
Inside, careful now.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.640
- Get inside.
- Hurry, go inside.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.640
- Quickly.
- Get inside.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.320
- Go first, go on.
- Get inside.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.120
Kids, we need to stay quiet now.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.240
If you’re loud, the enemies will take you.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.480
The elderly and children will hide together.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.320
It’ll be easier to look after them.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.040
Soldiers and volunteer forces

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.880
will set up ambushes.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.760
Spread out at different points.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.560
This plan will split them into small groups.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.120
And we can finish them off easier.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.800
So divide yourselves up,

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.640
choose who’ll take which post.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.280
As for me...

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.720
I’ll deal with that Somdet myself.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.400
Kosol.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.920
You’d better surrender.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.920
And I’ll spare your lives.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.720
Otherwise,

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.080
I’ll wipe you all out.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.840
Till Singhanakhon becomes a ghost town.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.760
Everyone!

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.560
You heard the enemy’s threats, right?

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.880
Defend our land

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.520
to the last breath!

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.280
Soldiers!

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.520
Whoever slaughters
the most Singhanakhon people

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.040
will earn a reward from me!

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.120
Charge!

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.000
Whoever’s hiding, come out now!

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.320
If I find you myself,
I’ll gut you on the spot.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.040
Forgive me.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.240
Please grant me absolution.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.440
Come out, no use hiding.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.600
I know someone’s inside.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.040
Come out!

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:52.040
If you don’t, I’ll break
the door down right now!

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.200
Break it down!

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.800
Harder!

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.600
Push again!

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.040
If they break through, what do we do?

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.880
They won’t get through.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.200
Because we’ve got help.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.640
Help?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.680
This house cat...

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.760
Why’s it so huge?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.040
Eat up, Mumu. Enjoy your meal.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.240
The one accusing others of treason

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.720
is the true traitor himself.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.480
I only seek to save the land.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.560
A weak king will bring ruin to the realm.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.440
I alone shall restore the nation.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.960
Aren’t you ashamed of your own vile words?

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.680
I’m sick of hearing them.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.280
Storm the palace!

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.400
Seize King Chaiyached!

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.760
Storm the palace!

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.320
Pandao, open the door. It’s me.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.240
Did you finish them all?

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.960
Mumu took care of them.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960
I doubt anyone else will come here.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.200
But stay here and look after the villagers.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.960
I’ll head into the city.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.600
Wait.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.600
Be careful.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.200
Thanks.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.800
Hey, wait,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.440
Mumu won’t…

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.080
eat me, will it?

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:47.320
Mumu doesn’t eat women.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.480
Dressed like this,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.560
I may be safe from Somdet’s soldiers,

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.040
but how can I be sure

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.880
I won’t be attacked by my own side?

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.040
Your Majesty.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.440
Everyone in Singhanakhon knows your face.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.040
No one would dare harm you, Your Majesty.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.360
Then stay close to me.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.840
If anyone tries to hurt me, you can help.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.360
The villagers are hiding over there, right?

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.280
No, sir.

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.280
They’re over there, but…

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.120
I just saw them that way.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.080
Or maybe they’ve all gone already.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.600
I really don’t remember, sir.

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.240
Attack.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.880
Banjong.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.120
Worradej, are you hurt anywhere?

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.840
I’m fine. Thank you so much.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.880
Banjong.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.120
Banjong.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.240
Banjong.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.680
Banjong.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.160
Banjong.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.240
Banjong, Banjong.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.760
Please, stop.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.200
Don’t do this.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.200
We’ve never had any grudge.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.520
And we didn’t even know each other before.

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.640
Please stop.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.560
I don’t want to kill you.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.240
But it’s my duty. Rest in peace.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.000
Kosol.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.440
Kosol, Kosol, help Banjong!

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:36.600
Banjong!

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.800
Your Majesty, using this ambush tactic
on the palace guards,

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.600
, we managed to push them back
and seize many of their weapons.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.000
Including this gun.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.720
It was also taken from the palace guards.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.080
But that Somdet Saenyakorn
still hasn’t been captured.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.760
I think,

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.800
, he must still be inside this palace.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.720
We need a way to lure him out.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.840
Take this.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.960
When the time is right, fire.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.920
That’s not right, Your Majesty.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.920
You’d be putting yourself
in too much danger.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.360
It should be Your Majesty
who takes the shot.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.640
Let me be the decoy instead.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.320
You can’t lure Somdet.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.200
He doesn’t care about you.
He only cares about me.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.520
But what if something goes wrong?

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.600
Somdet should be here by now.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.400
Enough talking. Do as I say.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.080
Running home already,
Somdet?

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.960
I didn’t realize

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.840
there was still one soldier
of Thanapura left.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.600
Your Majesty.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.560
Playtime is over.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.400
Come back to the palace with me.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.080
Back to being a puppet,

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:28.320
pulled by your strings
as before?

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.600
It’s you whose time is up.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.600
It’s time I took
the power back from you,

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.280
and handed it to its rightful owner.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.640
The rightful owner of power?

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.240
Don’t tell me you mean His Majesty himself.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.760
Jade, what are you doing?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.040
Why haven’t you fired yet?

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.520
Well?

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.320
Who do you mean?

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.360
Whoever I mean,
it doesn’t matter.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.800
But one thing’s for sure,
it isn’t yours.

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.840
Put down your ambition.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.280
Return to the order
where you belong.

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.040
The order where I belong?

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.840
I’ll decide that for myself.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.480
Jade.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.000
My lord.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.720
I found this one lying in wait
to shoot you.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.080
Jade.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.840
An ambush, is it?

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.560
Such dishonor is unworthy
of Your Majesty.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.480
Next time you fight me,

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.560
do it face-to-face.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.320
What would you have me do
with him?

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.400
Kill him.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.080
Don’t.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.040
You want me, don’t you?

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.280
Does it sting?

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.840
Bear with it.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.600
It’ll be over in a moment.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.760
Reckless fool.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.080
Who told you to be careless in battle?

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.800
Lucky you’re still alive.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.640
If that blade had cut deeper,

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.680
your bones would’ve been shattered.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.440
Hey Kosol.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.320
Can’t you speak nicely?

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.640
Banjong risked his life to save me
and got slashed on the back.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.960
Try praising someone. Comfort them.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.920
Say something kind for once.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.360
Let it go, Worradej.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.480
Just you applying medicine on me

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.200
already fills my heart.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.120
I don’t need hope from anyone else.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.040
Now you’re making me wonder.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.320
That you took the blade on your back

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.680
just to cozy up to Worradej?

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.280
Are you out of your mind?

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.160
Who would think like that?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.600
Go do your job already.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.960
I’ll stay here and look after Banjong.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.320
- You kicking me out?
- No.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.440
Or do you want to sit here with Banjong

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.880
while I go do your duties for you?

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.720
Does it hurt?

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.440
Hang in there, Banjong.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.720
Should’ve let him die instead of saving him.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.880
Don’t mind him.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.280
He probably missed going to
the fields this morning.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.680
That’s why he’s cranky
and taking it out on everyone.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.440
Lord Kosol, Lord Kosol!

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.320
Please help Jade!

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.160
What happened to Jade?

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.080
And where’s King Chaiyached?
Why are you here alone?

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:56.000
I was lying in wait to snipe Somdet.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.840
Then suddenly I blacked out.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.040
At that time, King Chaiyached
was with Somdet.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.520
Since you want to take the throne
in my place,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.800
why not kill me outright?
Why drag me back alive?

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.239
Hey Somdet.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:25.920
I am loyal to Your Majesty.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:29.320
I would never dare commit
such a grave sin.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.000
Yet you leash me like cattle,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.280
and still dare speak of loyalty?

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.920
That is because Your Majesty

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.120
has strayed too far off the path.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.520
I must force you back
into the rightful track.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.920
Somdet.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.320
Since I’m already in your grasp,

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.480
tell me clearly what’s on your mind.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.040
At least then I’ll know my place

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.960
and how I should conduct myself.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.800
If I were to kill Your Majesty,

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.400
I would lose all legitimacy
to seize power.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.280
But the provincial lords...

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.280
they would storm Thanapura,

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.640
accusing me of treason.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.960
Thus,

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.680
Your Majesty is still of great use to me.

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.240
So that’s how it is.

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.720
My Lord,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.600
someone is riding after us.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.480
It must be Kosol.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.200
He guards his brother
like a cobra guards its eggs.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.400
Shall we find cover first, My Lord?

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.760
Our forces are already too few,

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.520
and our weapons
have all been seized by them.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:57.800
If you know

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.280
you’re no match for my elder brother,

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.520
then crawl into a hole and hide.

00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.280
Otherwise my brother
will surely kill you.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.520
We’ll rest here for now.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.320
Once Kosol passes,
we’ll move on again.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.080
Yes, My Lord.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.240
Ched!

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.800
Ched!

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.480
Ched, where are you?

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.280
They’re getting closer, sir.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.520
Why did they stop the horse?

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.400
Where’s Your Majesty’s helmet?

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.960
You were wearing it earlier.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.080
Uh… I’m not sure, sir.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.120
But I saw Your Majesty wearing it on the way.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.280
The forest is vast.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.960
Kosol will never find us here.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.560
Hey!

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.160
Hey!

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.120
Stop!

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.080
Give it here.

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.200
Hand it over.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:02.080
Give it to me.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:06.760
Shameless grown-up stealing a kid’s toy.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.400
Jade, be my page.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.520
Ched and Jade sound alike,

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.440
so we’ll make a perfect duo.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.400
I already told you, you’re my friend.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.920
And what about His Majesty?

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.320
I know you can’t forget your old master.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.160
But don’t abandon me either.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.640
Jade.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.640
Your Majesty.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.960
What’s wrong? Why are you crying?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.120
I’m not crying, sir.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.840
Are you crying because
you’re worried about me?

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.600
And Your Majesty, you’re not hurt, are you?

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.200
My Lord.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.320
We should deal with Kosol first, sir.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.720
Why are you here alone?

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.680
Weren’t you captured by Samdet?

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.560
Yes, I was taken by him.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.360
But once they knew you were close behind,

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.120
they ran off in a hurry.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.280
At least they were wise
enough not to fight you.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.400
Did they hurt you at all?

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.760
Not at all. I’m fine, all in one piece.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.920
Chaiyached

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:31.320
Didn’t I tell you to stay put

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.880
Is it that hard not to risk yourself

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.800
See, I’m fine now

00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:37.280
Why are you scolding me

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.200
But what if something happened to you

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:41.320
Come on

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.200
I know you’d never let anything happen to me

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.600
Am I right

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.640
I just went out a bit, what could happen

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:03.800
You’re the one, are you okay

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.880
I’m fine, Your Majesty

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.040
Then why are you crying

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.840
You were worried about me, weren’t you

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.200
Hey, I’ve got something to tell you

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.960
Sit

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.640
That Somdet

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.160
He tied me up and dragged me off so far away

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.720
I walked till my legs gave out, sore all over

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.440
But I kept trying to find a way to escape

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:29.840
So I started talking to him

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.840
hoping I could dig out some secrets

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.800
And did you get anything, Your Highness?

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.040
Got plenty, actually

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.520
But I knew Kosol would come save me anyway

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.440
so I tossed my hat, and you really found me

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.400
I must apologize to you, Worradej

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.080
I truly caused you trouble

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.920
I’ll hurry to find a craftsman to make
you new glasses as soon as possible

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.600
so you won’t have to suffer

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:16.160
being my arms and legs like this

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.720
It’s all right

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.200
You risked your life to save me

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.800
let me do something
to repay your kindness

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.840
Until you get your new glasses

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.040
whatever you want to pick up or do

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.720
just call me anytime

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.800
I’ll be your eyes for you

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.200
Banjong, Banjong

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.160
How are you? Where did you get hit?

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.640
On the back

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.720
Wor, what did you do to my brother?

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.720
- Tell me now!
- Pandao

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.760
Worradej didn’t do anything to him

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.200
He went in to save him

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.880
and got hurt by the enemy

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.400
Go on, get out of here

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.080
I’ll take care of my brother myself

00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.200
I’m not leaving

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.400
I’m the reason Banjong got hurt

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.520
I’ll stay and look after him as atonement

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.560
- No need!
- Yes, need!

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.640
Shouldn’t you be at the infirmary
helping the wounded?

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.960
They’re already short-handed

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.920
I quit, I’ll leave and take care of my brother

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.360
- You should go help at the infirmary
- Pandao

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.040
Don’t you remember what we agreed?

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.400
I remember

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.720
Even if I’d rather not, honestly

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.480
Look, I already let you
take care of my brother

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:29.960
Then do it properly

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.320
I’ll come back to check later

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.720
No need for that

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.760
I can take better care of him than you

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.440
We’ve been through battles for a while now

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.840
So I think we should hold a celebration

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.640
Let everyone enjoy themselves
and bring back the spirit

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.960
To Somdet, our scouts reported

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.960
Singhanakhon will host a festival
on the full moon of the twelfth month

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.680
It’s said to be a grand event

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.400
I don’t know

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.520
what you’ve been through to become like this

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.880
But if one knows right from wrong

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.200
one should choose to change and improve

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.640
It’s up to you

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.120
whether you’ll accept it or not

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.440
(Come on, if you can take it)

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.040
Hold tight
(Come on, if you can take it)

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.560
Left, start with your left hand

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.200
Again, yeah

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.040
Ow, my hand hurts
(It’s already split open)

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.280
(Your hand’s hurt, Count)

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.080
Try using your knee

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.360
(Already flinched first)

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.240
(Why so startled, Count)

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:13.440
Cut

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.720
(Ears ringing now)
