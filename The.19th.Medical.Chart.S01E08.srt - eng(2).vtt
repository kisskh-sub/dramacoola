00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.039
Doctor.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.341
Please tell me…

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:12.812
the truth.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.080
I won't!

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.516
I won't tell you!

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.387
Doctor!

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.855
Dr. Akaike!

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.959
I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.
Requesting emergency transport.

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.697
- We need to hurry to the CT room.
- Got it!

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:34.467
Blood pressure at 78 over 46,
heart rate at 140.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.569
Oxygen maxed, oxygen saturation under 90.

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:39.739
Fluctuating consciousness, abdominal
distension, edema in the lower legs.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.374
Acute heart failure?

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:42.842
Cause of distension unknown.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.978
With his blood pressure, a same-day op--

00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:47.781
I suspect it's Budd-Chiari.

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:49.616
Budd-Chiari?

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.585
Toda, it's not heart failure.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.822
We'll do a thrombectomy.
No time to explain.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:58.591
- His inferior vena cava is blocked.
- We start with an angiography.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.094
- Prepare catheters and guidewires.
- On it!

00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:05.365
Now I know why you brought him to Uotora.

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.234
He's in your care, Dr. Chayasaka.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.637
Leave it to me.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.045
Dr. Tokushige,
is there anything I can do to help?

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.047
We can't do anything.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.085
Not yet.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.825
For the Uotora General Hospital
directorial elections,

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:35.528
does anyone object
that incumbent Dr. Eikichi Kitano

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:40.733
and the Head of Surgery,
Dr. Rokuro Togo, are the only candidates?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.536
- No objections.
- You have my approval too.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.875
Thus, the final debate will be held
next Monday as scheduled.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.579
Sorry for interrupting the meeting.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.950
It's Dr. Akaike.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:58.351
Akaike?

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:11.397
Akaike.

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.801
Your surgery went well.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:18.638
Budd-Chiari.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.574
"Blocked inferior vena cava
and hepatic veins

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:26.479
prevent blood return, resulting in liver
swelling and malfunction."

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.582
Toxins spread through the body,
quietly destroying it.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:32.318
Toxins…

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.787
I've treated acute forms of it in the US.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:38.291
I think the chronic symptoms
were present from the start.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:42.028
They are what caused
the swollen abdomen and visible veins.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:47.433
A fresh blood clot caused changes
that made him go into shock.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:49.235
Yes.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:53.706
There are cases like this in Japan too,
but very few.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.913
A venal pattern on the abdomen
resembling Medusa's head.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.717
Liver fibrosis has progressed,
leaving the organ barely functional.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.986
He is 75 years old.

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:10.156
He's barely still eligible, but…

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.725
You're suggesting a transplant?

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.561
It's a drastic solution.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.736
Excuse me.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.407
Dr. Akaike.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:39.152
I am here from General Medicine.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.520
I'm Dr. Tokushige.

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:43.856
Mr. Noboru Akaike.

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:49.562
I can confirm that you've been diagnosed
with Budd-Chiari syndrome.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.702
A blood clot in your IVC vein

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:58.805
has greatly impaired
blood flow to your liver--

00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:08.715
At the moment, you've been given
one month to live.

00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:10.683
Dr. Tokushige!

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:15.054
I apologize for telling you this
right after your surgery.

00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:20.059
However, we need to discuss
your further treatment options--

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.160
Tokushige.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:28.334
For a general physician,
the hardest thing to handle…

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.507
is when a patient falls silent,
am I right?

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.976
What do you mean, sir?

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:39.779
I'm saying my farewells.

00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.016
See you.

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:48.688
I'm not going to…

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.826
say another word.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:09.342
GENERAL MEDICINE

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:21.521
Dr. Akaike.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.456
Good morning.

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:33.700
Wow, the sun is still dazzling.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.269
But it's a bit cooler now.

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:40.907
Also, the breeze feels a little nicer
now when I'm on my bike.

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:48.081
Would you like to go out for a while?

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:50.650
I don't have to see outpatients
until this afternoon.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:59.492
He's just turning down treatment?

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:05.098
This man has dedicated his life
to establishing general medicine in Japan.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:08.501
He fought harder than anyone else,

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:12.505
struggling to fix our nation's
fragmented healthcare system.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.678
When he said he'd close his clinic,
I should have asked for more reasons.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.414
If only I had realized sooner.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.284
Acute exacerbations are extremely rare,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.787
so I don't think
anyone could have predicted it.

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:30.757
Even Dr. Akaike himself.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:31.991
Tokushige.

00:06:32.625 --> 00:06:33.626
Yes?

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:40.600
We must carry on Dr. Akaike's will.

00:06:42.502 --> 00:06:43.636
Sir.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.774
You're face is scary looking right now.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.708
Huh?

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:54.147
With that face, your closing argument
won't work on anyone.

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:55.081
Hey, you…

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:57.884
Sir, you have a lovely smile.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:01.721
Well then, let's both do our best.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.825
What's with that carefree attitude?

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:06.926
Excuse me.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:12.365
{\an8}BUDD-CHIARI SYNDROME

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:18.638
Your body won't hold up without a meal.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:20.773
Help yourself if you want.

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.109
Don't mind if I do.

00:07:30.383 --> 00:07:31.751
Eat up, okay?

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:51.270
Come on in.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:54.874
The finest snacks in town,
pediatrician-approved.

00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:56.943
Thank you so much!

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:59.479
But what brings you here?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.516
Are you all right?

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:11.624
At times like this,
the older you get, the less you can say.

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.026
Because no one will listen anyway.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.567
I wouldn't say that I'm okay.

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:28.241
Doctors can't do anything
unless they're asked.

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:32.278
Dr. Akaike taught me that.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.782
However…

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.755
we can't just stand still.

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:48.227
I'll make some coffee.

00:08:52.932 --> 00:08:56.502
The directorial election
is also troubling me.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:02.341
If Dr. Togo takes the top spot,
he said he'll downsize Pediatrics.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:07.947
But, we have to think
about what we can do.

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.385
For now, we must focus
on treating our patients!

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.095
Doctor?

00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:25.865
It's nothing.

00:09:28.668 --> 00:09:30.403
I think you're right.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.040
All right!

00:09:34.106 --> 00:09:36.108
Let's fill up and get to work!

00:09:36.175 --> 00:09:37.276
Okay.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.377
I'm leaving these here.

00:09:38.444 --> 00:09:39.278
Okay.

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:41.447
Please don't hog them all for yourself.

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:42.515
Understood!

00:09:44.016 --> 00:09:44.951
Excuse me.

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.633
Hello.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:01.601
Oh!

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:04.003
Want some? They were a gift.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.004
Sure.

00:10:06.772 --> 00:10:10.042
Wow, I'll take this one.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:13.012
{\an8}GENERAL MEDICINE QUESTIONNAIRE

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.282
Come in.

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.222
Nice to meet you.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.825
I'm Dr. Mizuki Takino
from General Medicine.

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:27.893
Nice to meet you.

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:29.261
Have a seat.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.030
You too, please.

00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.398
Thank you.

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:39.205
You're Emi Takaoka?

00:10:39.805 --> 00:10:41.240
What brings you here today?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.945
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

00:10:46.846 --> 00:10:47.880
Sorry.

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:50.583
I can't stop coughing.

00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:53.653
Coughing… since when?

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.422
Beginning of last month.

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:58.991
I caught a cold.

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.559
It's been over a month…

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.595
It never stopped?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.299
I have a band competition next month.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.169
I want to…

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.974
Does it hurt? Are you okay?

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:16.275
I'm sorry.

00:11:18.144 --> 00:11:20.613
She had asthma as a kid?

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.715
There might be a predisposition.

00:11:22.782 --> 00:11:24.550
But she's not wheezing.

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:27.253
- What about cough-variant asthma?
- No response to steroids.

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:29.989
Whoa! You scared me.

00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:32.291
What about environmental factors
or stress?

00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:35.561
It could be. Her band has a competition.

00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:37.997
Coughing makes you very self-aware, right?

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.065
Yes.

00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:43.769
Dr. Narumi!

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.871
{\an8}UOTORA GENERAL HOSPITAL

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.641
Hey!

00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:55.781
The coughing causes muscular pain
at the solar plexus.

00:11:55.848 --> 00:11:59.118
It typically goes with tenderness
and worsens with deep breathing.

00:11:59.185 --> 00:12:00.219
That's what I thought.

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.521
But no apparent orthopedic abnormality.

00:12:02.588 --> 00:12:03.489
Excuse me.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.057
Dr. Narumi!

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:07.693
I…

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:14.400
Don't just stop me! Say something!

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:15.468
Sorry.

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:20.406
Did you become one?

00:12:21.574 --> 00:12:22.475
What?

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.112
A doctor who can cure anything.

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:28.214
Not yet, sir.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.248
Oh, really?

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.852
"Yet" means that you will one day, right?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.259
Do your best, Takino.

00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:46.832
Gosh, I wasted 11 minutes on this!

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:52.938
Thank you, sir!

00:12:57.476 --> 00:12:59.411
{\an8}- Is it plugged in?
- Yes.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.314
{\an8}Alexa, switch on.

00:13:04.717 --> 00:13:05.651
{\an8}Excuse us.

00:13:05.718 --> 00:13:08.387
{\an8}This is how you'll watch
my closing argument.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.823
Technology is so convenient.

00:13:11.457 --> 00:13:13.659
Please make sure to watch.

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.928
I'll give my best speech.

00:13:15.995 --> 00:13:18.864
I'll be lonely
if I'm just talking to myself.

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:25.137
I've decided to take the equivalency exam.

00:13:26.238 --> 00:13:29.141
So you managed
to talk to your dad about it?

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.309
Yes.

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:33.879
I wasn't sure about it,
even after talking it over.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.150
But I consulted with Dad many times,

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:42.154
and had Mr. Kariya
look into various things for me.

00:13:43.255 --> 00:13:46.225
I want to give it a go.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.096
I'm happy for you.

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:57.002
Taku, you've started exploring
your own future.

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:03.676
Taku, wasn't there something else
you wanted to say?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.447
What is it? Tell us.

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.082
It's nothing…

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:15.154
If I pass and go to college…

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.591
I'd like to study medicine.

00:14:18.657 --> 00:14:20.192
Really?

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:21.694
Oh, wait a second.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.930
I haven't decided to become a doctor
or anything like that yet.

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.900
I'm not good at studying after all.

00:14:30.236 --> 00:14:31.437
But…

00:14:34.807 --> 00:14:38.510
I can afford to worry and hesitate…

00:14:40.179 --> 00:14:42.381
because I met you, Doctor.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.586
I still get very scared at times.

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:54.693
Sometimes, I still freeze up,
wondering if this is right.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:15:00.399
But when I come here, you're here.

00:15:05.738 --> 00:15:09.708
I want to be a presence
like you for someone.

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:18.884
Thank you.

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:21.220
What?

00:15:25.224 --> 00:15:26.458
I mean it…

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:30.663
Thank you.

00:15:41.273 --> 00:15:43.542
Taku Okazaki is here!

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:45.077
Yes.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:48.981
And Akira Tokushige is here too. Right?

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.183
Yes!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.736
What brings you here, traitor?

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:12.838
What harsh words.

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:16.875
That's because
I haven't forgiven you or Uotora.

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:18.911
- Get me the pulse oximeter.
- Okay.

00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:25.517
Here.

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:30.990
I enjoyed working in the ER.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:33.592
I know.

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:39.765
But, you're one
helplessly selfish knucklehead.

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.102
That's harsh.

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:45.738
I did you one more favor.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:50.075
I even signed it.

00:16:51.577 --> 00:16:52.711
Thank you.

00:16:56.448 --> 00:16:58.884
Now get moving. I'm busy here.

00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:01.520
I know, sir.

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:06.258
In return,
I'll come to help you out next time.

00:17:07.993 --> 00:17:09.661
I'm not counting on it!

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:21.206
What a complete idiot.

00:17:21.707 --> 00:17:23.275
What is he thinking?

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.819
RESIDENCE CERTIFICATE

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:46.365
When I was away,
you took care of Dr. Takino.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:51.470
It was in my own interests.

00:17:54.506 --> 00:17:57.643
Doctors are to team up
for their patients' sake…

00:17:59.845 --> 00:18:02.448
I wanted to try it out for myself.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.351
I wanted to tell my father that.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:14.626
To that end, I meddled in a Cardio surgery
and got General Medicine involved.

00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:18.597
I see.

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.534
However, I only made things worse.

00:18:23.435 --> 00:18:24.470
Oh my?

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:27.840
He told me to get out.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.247
I did something unnecessary.

00:18:35.314 --> 00:18:37.182
No, you didn't.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.086
I was told the same thing.

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.257
By Dr. Akaike?

00:18:47.259 --> 00:18:51.163
Our mentors are a handful, aren't they?

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:04.143
We could just let things
take their course.

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.292
I can't give up.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.396
I don't want to give up.

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:28.901
Yes.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.576
EMI TAKAOKA
ASTHMA, WHOOPING COUGH, ESOPHAGITIS

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.314
Guess I'm no psychic.

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:48.086
Excuse me. Is Dr. Tokushige here?

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:51.423
His conference
with Internal is running late.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.960
Please tell him I've booked a slot
for the test he requested.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:56.395
- A test?
- Yes.

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:58.330
The time can be checked in the system.

00:19:58.397 --> 00:20:00.065
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:20:09.274 --> 00:20:10.242
I'm back.

00:20:10.309 --> 00:20:12.177
Ms. Seto came just now.

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:13.245
Oh, the test.

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:15.547
- For Dr. Akaike?
- Yes.

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:18.450
He's about to be discharged, right?

00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:21.220
Yeah.

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:24.423
The puncture site is healing up nicely.

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:26.124
He has no trouble walking either.

00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:43.408
AKIRA TOKUSHIGE

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:49.348
The Japanese medical system
is now at a breaking point.

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:52.050
Demand continues to surge,

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:55.487
and both manpower and budget
are struggling to keep up.

00:20:56.788 --> 00:20:59.858
In order to safeguard
Uotora General Hospital,

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:02.127
I shall propose some necessary revisions.

00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:04.796
Concentrating limited personnel

00:21:04.863 --> 00:21:08.100
in departments that can balance
specialization and efficiency

00:21:08.667 --> 00:21:14.306
such as ORs, perioperative care,
and health screening centers.

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:19.811
Ideals alone cannot sustain healthcare.

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:26.051
This is unlikely to get interesting.

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:27.586
What?

00:21:27.653 --> 00:21:31.890
I mean, everything he says is right.

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:34.960
Call me cold-hearted if you like.

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:41.566
Nevertheless,
I will uphold my duty and go down

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:44.169
this path.

00:21:49.374 --> 00:21:51.777
Well then, any questions?

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.082
Let's move on to the next candidate, then.

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.255
Dr. Kojiro Togo.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.156
Go ahead.

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.530
Your current policy proposal

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.768
involves downsizing Pediatrics
and abolishing General Medicine.

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:17.669
Yes.

00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:20.706
Pediatrics is the bedrock
of community healthcare,

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:22.240
despite the falling birth rate.

00:22:22.307 --> 00:22:25.377
Do you know how much
Pediatrics loses in a year?

00:22:26.178 --> 00:22:30.015
The hospital is not a charity.

00:22:35.987 --> 00:22:37.222
I understand that.

00:22:41.493 --> 00:22:44.763
But even with a growing aging population,
there are still children.

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:49.167
I admit that Pediatrics,
and also General Medicine,

00:22:49.234 --> 00:22:50.202
are not profitable yet--

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:52.371
To look at things from a broad
perspective, without rushing.

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:55.040
You're all well aware that such services

00:22:55.107 --> 00:22:58.210
are underappreciated
in the current system.

00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:03.382
Proposing ideals that don't fit the system
will only burden those on the ground.

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.350
Am I wrong?

00:23:06.184 --> 00:23:07.386
No.

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:09.488
Not about any of it.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:14.192
Japan's healthcare system
has many wonderful aspects.

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:18.230
But the system is designed
to protect the masses.

00:23:19.531 --> 00:23:22.100
What about those
who fall through the cracks?

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:28.607
Can we pretend they don't exist?

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:33.512
I know that kindness alone won't do.

00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.647
That's the reality.

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:41.219
But if we lose our kindness…

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:45.090
then we cannot remain doctors.

00:24:17.823 --> 00:24:18.957
Well…

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:24.796
I feel like most of what I was
going to say has already been said…

00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:26.364
However, let me say one thing.

00:24:27.966 --> 00:24:30.735
It is a hassle to make changes.

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.606
It took years of debate

00:24:34.673 --> 00:24:38.910
before ambulance paramedics
were authorized to perform intubations.

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:43.748
The same goes for nurses
performing airway suctioning.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:46.585
What is the right answer?

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.955
Is there even a right answer?

00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:56.895
We will always be faced
with such questions.

00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:02.334
Truly, there's no end
to what we can talk about.

00:25:04.169 --> 00:25:06.705
Sorry, I've been dragging on.

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:11.610
But I'll keep having these conversations.

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:18.116
I won't stay silent
because it may be troublesome.

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.589
Everybody.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.292
Please, lend me your hand.

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:33.932
I will do all I can.

00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:53.151
{\an8}The election has been called off
because Dr. Togo pulled out.

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.320
Things won't change that easily.

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.523
Yeah.

00:26:00.158 --> 00:26:02.260
But I think he got through to him.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.768
Rokuro!

00:26:10.702 --> 00:26:12.404
How humiliating!

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:13.939
Oh, come on.

00:26:14.005 --> 00:26:16.841
We're still old pals, aren't we?

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:19.878
My son rebuked me in front of everyone.

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:23.815
Kids will grow up,
even as we hold them back.

00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:26.117
They'll gain their own voice.

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:28.920
Sorry for making that decision
without consulting you.

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:31.389
The General Medicine Department…

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:35.293
Even if we clashed,
we should've found the answer together.

00:26:36.628 --> 00:26:38.663
I'm really sorry.

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:41.933
It's fine!

00:26:42.534 --> 00:26:46.338
I'll raise tons of money,
so together, let's make Uotora--

00:26:46.404 --> 00:26:47.806
You're a money-grubber!

00:26:47.872 --> 00:26:49.307
Oh, come on!

00:26:49.374 --> 00:26:51.076
I won't expect anything.

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:54.045
But if you properly
consider the insurance system,

00:26:54.112 --> 00:26:58.083
having a General Medicine Department
can have us break even in ten years.

00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:59.951
You're getting way ahead of yourself!

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:03.922
It's not that far, just ten years…
They will go by in a flash.

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:09.227
I'm seeing a patient
whose coughing just won't stop.

00:27:10.261 --> 00:27:12.130
A 17-year-old girl.

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:21.006
Asthma, whooping cough, and esophagitis.

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:27.178
I've looked at various possibilities,
but I can't find the answer.

00:27:30.749 --> 00:27:34.319
The reason I became a general physician

00:27:35.286 --> 00:27:38.189
was because I was frustrated
at not being able to cure a cold.

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:44.062
I still feel that way to this day.

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.033
But…

00:27:50.535 --> 00:27:53.138
When I'm face-to-face
with patients like this,

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:57.375
I'm not too concerned
about myself or such.

00:27:58.109 --> 00:27:59.310
I just…

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.313
I really…

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:05.884
want to do something.

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:10.188
That's all.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.030
You don't have to try to name the disease.

00:28:23.835 --> 00:28:27.038
What's ailing this girl,

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:33.545
you may not know its name,
but you can already tell what it is.

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:36.781
Doctor.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.660
Can I talk to you for a bit?

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:56.067
I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.

00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:58.536
Thank you for coming.

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:02.841
Mr. Noboru Akaike.

00:29:05.744 --> 00:29:06.578
Well…

00:29:07.545 --> 00:29:10.148
There's no point in being so formal,

00:29:10.215 --> 00:29:13.184
so shall I just address you as usual,
Dr. Akaike?

00:29:15.253 --> 00:29:21.192
Do you still insist on your stance
to refuse treatment?

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:30.702
Dr. Akaike, why won't you answer?

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:34.339
I want to hear more--

00:29:34.405 --> 00:29:35.707
Dr. Takino.

00:29:38.376 --> 00:29:39.410
Sorry.

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:42.647
At this point,

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:48.086
medication can no longer
stop it from spreading.

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:53.424
As for a drastic solution,

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:57.095
a liver transplant is your only option.

00:29:59.564 --> 00:30:00.698
How, you ask?

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:03.301
That's right.

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:07.772
You don't have a family.

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:10.041
Therefore…

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:14.145
I'll be your donor.

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:23.655
Of course, it's anything but simple.

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.492
The Japanese Transplantation Society's
ethical guidelines

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:32.197
generally state that living liver donors
should be limited to relatives.

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:38.169
As for non-related donors,
they'll undergo screening

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:42.040
to prevent organ trafficking or coercion.

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.243
Therefore…

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:48.947
I even signed it.

00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:52.884
{\an8}My proof of identity.

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.852
{\an8}EMPLOYMENT CERTIFICATE

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:55.286
{\an8}LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

00:30:57.255 --> 00:31:00.091
Official records,
showing we lived together.

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.893
RELATIONSHIP: COHABITOR

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.595
Let me roll up your sleeve.

00:31:04.863 --> 00:31:05.964
Here you go…

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.433
If I am a match to be your donor.

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:13.371
Also, I'll no longer be your doctor.

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:17.075
To avoid
any ethical conflicts of interest,

00:31:17.709 --> 00:31:19.978
I will hand you over to the surgeons.

00:31:20.912 --> 00:31:25.850
From now on,
there'll be various tests and interviews.

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:31.656
It may take some time.

00:31:32.991 --> 00:31:36.828
But I just wanted to let you know now.

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:52.110
How about we go over the benefits
and risks of a transplant.

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:59.217
First of all, I, the donor,
will undergo a laparoscopy.

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:03.121
The left lobe will be used
for the transplant.

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.490
Left lobe?

00:32:07.525 --> 00:32:10.461
It will surely leave a burden on my body.

00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:15.400
But the liver
has a high regenerative capacity,

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:17.769
and its function will recover.

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:26.377
And now, you, as the recipient,
will undergo a laparotomy.

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:31.349
Your liver will be almost totally removed.

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:35.553
Therefore it will take time to recover.

00:32:37.956 --> 00:32:41.259
As I mentioned, as you are now,

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.396
you only have one month to live.

00:32:47.598 --> 00:32:51.436
But if the transplant is a success,

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:57.942
you'll have the chance
to live out your natural lifespan.

00:33:01.012 --> 00:33:05.149
How does that benefit me?

00:33:06.718 --> 00:33:09.020
The lifespan of an old man.

00:33:11.489 --> 00:33:16.160
I've done all I can do.

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:22.834
I've struggled and fought.

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:30.908
There is nothing more I can do.

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:37.415
There's nothing more you can do?

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.251
What will I live for?

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:58.002
I've fought in my own way.

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:05.777
To unravel my suffering…

00:34:08.446 --> 00:34:11.449
Helping those who slip through the cracks

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:15.820
between specialties.

00:34:21.859 --> 00:34:27.198
The 19th medical specialty,
General Medicine.

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:35.540
The best day ever…

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:38.376
{\an8}THE 19TH SPECIALTY DEBUTS

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:40.344
One that I'll never forget.

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:46.784
At last, we'd made it
to the starting line.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.787
Or so I thought.

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:52.690
But…

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:58.296
"I truly understand what you're saying."

00:34:59.864 --> 00:35:04.769
What would come right
after that sentence was always

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:08.739
"But you see, Doctor…"

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:13.678
"I'm sorry, Dr. Akaike.

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:18.850
Our hospital cannot afford to maintain
a General Medicine Department."

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.420
Dr. Akaike!

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.030
Ideals are ideals.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.300
Reality is reality.

00:35:38.436 --> 00:35:41.005
{\an8}Blazing a trail where none existed.

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:45.810
{\an8}Alone on the night sea,

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:50.948
{\an8}aiming for the faint glow in the distance.

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:58.089
{\an8}I did all I could.

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:11.402
No matter how hard I grasp it,

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:16.607
it just slips away through my fingers.

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:22.980
An endless dream.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.352
One I've clung to for dear life.

00:36:31.789 --> 00:36:33.024
Whether…

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:42.633
that was the right move or a mistake…

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:46.337
I don't know.

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:52.109
Tokushige.

00:36:55.046 --> 00:37:01.485
I never wanted
to have this conversation you!

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:21.405
So, we've all been living a dream?

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:30.448
All I see is a patient pleading,

00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:32.717
"Help me."

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:41.626
For me, that's reality.

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:53.704
The one who taught me that,
is you, Dr. Akaike.

00:38:02.346 --> 00:38:03.447
Doctor.

00:38:05.916 --> 00:38:07.285
Tell me.

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:16.227
Why did you plant seeds

00:38:17.862 --> 00:38:19.497
in the field back then?

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:28.005
Why…

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:35.313
did you answer
when Dr. Takino spoke to you?

00:38:42.887 --> 00:38:44.021
Why?

00:38:50.361 --> 00:38:51.495
Why?

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:56.500
Why are you giving up?

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.243
I'm giving up?

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:21.325
I believed in you.

00:39:23.527 --> 00:39:25.396
That's why I went after you.

00:39:39.276 --> 00:39:40.444
Doctor.

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.854
The General Medicine Department…

00:39:52.256 --> 00:39:55.292
is only just getting started, isn't it?

00:40:02.199 --> 00:40:03.033
Yeah.

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:09.373
See it through, okay?

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:16.647
Whether what you started…

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:26.924
was the right move or a mistake.

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:39.203
Whatever the outcome,
as a fellow general physician,

00:40:40.971 --> 00:40:47.812
I am right here,
prepared to carry it all with you.

00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:00.691
So…

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:06.797
from now on…

00:41:11.902 --> 00:41:13.204
Let's struggle.

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:15.840
Let's fight.

00:41:19.243 --> 00:41:21.579
Let's furrow our brows.

00:41:24.949 --> 00:41:26.784
Let's keep on living.

00:41:40.631 --> 00:41:42.333
You, Dr. Akaike…

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:46.670
and me.

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:53.110
And me too.

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:59.750
A doctor who can cure anything.

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:05.523
I am not going to give up on that.

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:17.368
I've learned that with help
I might be able to become one.

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:35.019
Are you sure about this?

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:40.925
Yes.

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.631
In exchange,

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:51.902
I'm going to have you work hard.

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:59.677
You are truly selfish.

00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:09.186
I got that from you.

00:43:15.025 --> 00:43:16.226
Yes.

00:43:30.474 --> 00:43:31.308
{\an8}RESEARCH PROPOSAL

00:43:31.375 --> 00:43:33.344
The donor is one of our physicians.

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:36.280
I am aware of the ethical concerns.

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:43.153
As long as there are options, we believe
we should thoroughly consider them.

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:47.658
{\an8}Dr. Akaike has opted for treatment.

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:48.626
{\an8}Yeah.

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.760
{\an8}RESEARCH PROPOSAL

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:54.231
{\an8}It's a rare case,
but if it makes sense, we'll proceed.

00:43:55.499 --> 00:43:58.302
{\an8}As long as it's open and honest.

00:43:58.369 --> 00:44:02.239
{\an8}First, we do a resection
centered on the left of the liver,

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.942
temporarily blocking
blood flow to the hepatic artery

00:44:05.542 --> 00:44:07.544
to preserve the donor's liver function

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:10.481
as we ensure the recipient
gets the needed function.

00:44:10.547 --> 00:44:13.651
I'll handle any bleeding during surgery.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:16.020
The risks will be shared by all.

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:18.255
What about the blood transfusions
and anesthesia?

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.690
We'll prepare in advance.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.263
I find your smile a little uncomfortable.

00:44:27.831 --> 00:44:29.266
I'm just happy.

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:03.767
So, this is how it feels…

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:10.841
Please keep a close eye
on the fluid balance.

00:45:11.408 --> 00:45:13.077
I felt a bit dehydrated yesterday.

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:16.447
It's going to be all right.
Please lie down already.

00:45:17.815 --> 00:45:19.383
Sorry.

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:29.927
I'm all yours.

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:34.732
Vitals stable.

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.500
Inducing anesthesia.

00:45:37.101 --> 00:45:38.235
Got it.

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:46.009
I'm confident in my surgical skills.

00:45:47.444 --> 00:45:48.812
I know.

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.951
Excuse me, I'm placing the mask.

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.387
Breathe in.

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:01.859
Electrosurgical unit.

00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:10.834
Forceps.

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:14.772
Come for some fun, Dr. Chayasaka?

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.909
I see you've learned to joke around.

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:28.519
Thank you for seeing me.

00:46:31.188 --> 00:46:33.090
No need to force yourself to talk.

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.058
Sorry.

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:45.402
Does it settle after drinking water?

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.809
I just had a look at the extent
of the inflammation in your throat.

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.378
It's looking a lot better.

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:59.550
But there is still a small amount of
inflammation in the back of your throat.

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:02.619
Everything else is fine.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.722
So, why…

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:14.164
You cough while talking,
when you wake up or in dry conditions.

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:20.070
The mucous membrane in your bronchial tube
may have become hypersensitive.

00:47:21.305 --> 00:47:24.708
You're also worried about
your band competition, right?

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:28.879
Yes.

00:47:29.646 --> 00:47:34.084
Trying to speak while healing,
might have strained your throat a bit.

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:38.455
So, to summarize what we've discussed,

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:43.760
the cause of your cough, Emi, is a cold.

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:46.997
What?

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.333
A lingering cold.

00:47:51.635 --> 00:47:55.205
I checked thoroughly
and found no other problems.

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.074
Nothing to worry about.

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:04.948
I'm sorry, I made such a fuss over a cold…

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.320
You've been anxious.

00:48:14.124 --> 00:48:16.960
It's exhausting
when it never seems to get better.

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:25.636
For the sake of your competition,
as well as yourself, please rest.

00:48:29.172 --> 00:48:30.641
Will I get better?

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:34.678
Eat well and get plenty of sleep.

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.948
That should make you better.

00:48:41.018 --> 00:48:42.052
Okay.

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:46.823
I'm so glad.

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:11.248
Here you go.

00:49:16.586 --> 00:49:17.788
Here.

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:05.102
It appears I'm still alive.

00:50:09.573 --> 00:50:11.308
Yeah.

00:51:01.858 --> 00:51:02.893
Mr. Yokobuki.

00:51:04.027 --> 00:51:05.362
Dr. Takino.

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:09.232
It's gotten much cooler
these days, hasn't it?

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.133
Yes.

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:12.235
How time flies.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:15.705
It'll be harder for me to wash the dishes.

00:51:16.273 --> 00:51:17.541
Chillblains.

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:20.110
Be sure to keep warm
all the way to the wrists.

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.645
It will improve your circulation.

00:51:21.711 --> 00:51:23.613
And don't forget to moisturize.

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:26.650
You're one great doctor,
treating everything.

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:28.652
Not quite yet.

00:51:43.467 --> 00:51:45.268
You're a slowpoke, aren't you?

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:49.372
But, you've gotten three seconds faster.

00:51:51.441 --> 00:51:53.210
Do you have a minute, Dr. Arimatsu?

00:51:53.276 --> 00:51:55.412
- I have outpatients in ten.
- Just three minutes.

00:51:55.479 --> 00:51:59.149
So, let's take our time
going over it once I'm done.

00:51:59.216 --> 00:52:01.418
Thank you so much. I'll share my chart.

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:02.452
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

00:52:02.519 --> 00:52:04.821
Dr. Hirate, may I get your advice?

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:06.723
- Okay.
- Sorry. Um, yesterday…

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.859
It's gotten noisy in here.

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:10.927
- What?
- They aren't in any pain.

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:12.362
I see.

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:14.831
I guess it's nice from time to time.

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:24.074
Did you have lunch?

00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.143
- I did!
- You did?

00:52:26.209 --> 00:52:28.612
Really? I'm not sure it's enough.

00:52:28.678 --> 00:52:30.447
Please eat up.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:35.819
- I'm off!
- See you later!

00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:38.188
PETITION TO CREATE
A GENERAL PRACTICE SUPPORT PROGRAM

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:40.624
Let's go.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.591
Yeah.

00:52:48.832 --> 00:52:50.867
All right, that's it.

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:53.303
Sorry, thank you for seeing us so quickly.

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.071
- It's nothing.
- Let's go.

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:56.873
See you around.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.608
Say "Goodbye, Doctor."

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.644
- Red Beard.
- Huh?

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.979
Where are you going, all dressed up?

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:06.917
Where am I going? Somewhere nice.

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:13.523
{\an8}We in the General Medicine Department
treat people, not organs.

00:53:14.024 --> 00:53:16.159
That's why our department was established.

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:21.097
That explanation may be
a little confusing.

00:53:21.831 --> 00:53:22.933
Well…

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:32.142
By seeing someone other than ourselves,

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:39.382
we become just a little kinder.

00:53:44.454 --> 00:53:47.090
By seeing someone other than ourselves,

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:52.295
we become just a little kinder.

00:53:56.666 --> 00:53:59.469
That's all that matters.

00:54:16.019 --> 00:54:17.621
I knew it.

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.023
It's narrow here.

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.435
They made it even.

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:36.906
It's Dr. Tokushige.

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:38.942
{\an8}Good morning, Doctor.

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:42.479
{\an8}- Good morning, Dr. Tokushige.
- Good morning.

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:43.947
{\an8}Good morning!

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:00.363
{\an8}How's your pain now?

00:55:02.032 --> 00:55:04.868
{\an8}I still feel pain sometimes.

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.937
{\an8}But I exercise and stretch.

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:12.242
{\an8}And once I found the right meds,
I improved quite a lot.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:18.548
{\an8}At work, I'm still busy as ever.

00:55:19.549 --> 00:55:24.821
{\an8}But I've come to realize that it's okay
to take a break once in a while.

00:55:27.457 --> 00:55:29.225
{\an8}That's what matters most.

00:55:31.094 --> 00:55:37.233
{\an8}It's all because of your words
and your help back then.

00:55:40.236 --> 00:55:43.907
{\an8}I'm so glad I didn't give up.

00:55:47.577 --> 00:55:50.280
{\an8}That was before
my curtains arrived, right?

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:53.750
{\an8}Yeah, it was really bright.

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:59.823
{\an8}Ms. Kuroiwa, you were the first patient,

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:04.694
{\an8}whom I examined,
right after I joined Uotora.

00:56:05.595 --> 00:56:06.663
{\an8}Really?

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:07.630
{\an8}Yeah.

00:56:09.866 --> 00:56:14.537
{\an8}Back then,
when you smiled for the first time…

00:56:17.974 --> 00:56:19.976
{\an8}I think I will remember
that smile forever.

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:30.720
{\an8}I'm glad…

00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:34.724
{\an8}I got to speak with you.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.062
{\an8}It's also my pleasure.

00:56:42.499 --> 00:56:44.734
{\an8}Well, see you around.

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:45.935
{\an8}Yeah.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.204
{\an8}Take care.

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:14.364
Currently, there are 320,000
active physicians in Japan.

00:57:14.931 --> 00:57:20.003
Among them, there are only
about 1,000 general physicians.

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:23.840
We're just getting started.

00:57:24.574 --> 00:57:29.446
It takes time for new things
to gain acceptance.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:34.083
But that's how healthcare has evolved.

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:38.888
Every doctor wants to save
as many patients as they can.

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:41.991
There isn't a single doctor
who doesn't wish for that.

00:57:43.426 --> 00:57:46.029
Healthcare that leaves no one behind,

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:50.567
medical staff working together
to care for patients,

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.837
and a system where we join forces

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:56.706
not just within hospitals,
but across the entire community.

00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:02.712
I believe we can
make this ideal a reality.

00:58:04.214 --> 00:58:05.181
That's why…

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.253
I'm here again today.

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:15.925
Good morning, Dr. Tokushige.

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:18.895
Good morning. Shall we start our day?

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:20.763
Yes, I'll get the patient now.

00:58:23.166 --> 00:58:25.134
GENERAL MEDICINE DEPARTMENT

00:58:25.635 --> 00:58:26.603
Come in.

00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:30.840
I'm Dr. Tokushige from General Medicine.

00:58:31.875 --> 00:58:33.510
What brings you here today?

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.886
Please tell me…

00:58:45.655 --> 00:58:47.257
your story.

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:54.731
