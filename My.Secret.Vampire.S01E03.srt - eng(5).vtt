The perfect combination of high fat
and high carbohydrates.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.630
Add a spoonful of sweet honey
on top of vitamin-filled fruits.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.140
Not too much, nor too little.
Just 5 kg, Han Dongha.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.539
What's going on?

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.970
A war broke out?

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.300
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.450
You guys...

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.940
What's all this?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.750
You must be tired
having to start work early in the morning.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.980
Wait!

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.500
Dongha,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.430
you keep going to work
without eating breakfast every day.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.360
Eat this and work hard.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.979
Don't feel too burdened.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.970
Thank you.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.000
Take care!

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.259
People would think you gave birth to him.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.729
We didn't give birth to him,
but we are raising him.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.680
With a loving heart.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.600
What kind of creepy stuff
are you saying early in the morning?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.250
Dongha! Give me your bag.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.550
It'll be a waste if you lose fat.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.130
Let's go.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.530
Be careful. Very good.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.260
Be careful.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.470
Don't open your eyes.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.740
All right.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.460
Don't open your eyes.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.860
Is today a special day?

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.590
It's a special day.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.150
It's the Han Dongha Welcome Ceremony!

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.900
Applause!

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.280
Blow out the candles.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.200
These are all yours.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.980
We feel full just by looking at you eat.
Eat up.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.320
Thank you.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.150
It's good.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.340
Do you want to have this too?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.420
Shall I?

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.900
Why aren't you eating?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.960
It's good. Eat up.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.830
Hyung, you eat things like that too?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.880
Of course. This is delicious.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.980
Why? Aren't you eating?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.240
I don't feel like it...

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.770
Look at how skinny you are, Gyumin.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.900
You could faint anytime.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.320
No, I'm fine.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.500
You'll faint.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.630
Ah...

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.490
Chew slowly.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.480
Wait, wait.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.750
My phone...

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.740
Where are you going?

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.660
Hello?

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.950
It's good.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.470
Come here.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.180
Gyumin! Are you okay?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.320
Gyumin!

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.730
Traitor!

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.070
He ran away alone.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.780
You can leave too.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.060
I'm scared of Joowon.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.990
I had to lay for a week when he beat me up
for being rude.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.159
Come on. You're so tall for nothing.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.170
Are you okay?

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.150
Yes.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.090
I'm scared of Joowon too now.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.080
Did you see that?

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.320
How he doesn't even vomit
when he eats human food?

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.510
Does he dislike the fact that

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.770
we want some of Dongha's blood that much?

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.920
I wonder if Joowon is better now.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.850
Of course not.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.350
A dessert?

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.380
Forget it.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.870
That's right.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.130
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.080
What?

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.190
You don't eat what I gave you.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.750
But you eat what everyone else gives you.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.480
Think whatever you want.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.430
Hey. You don't look well.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.420
Just give me a second.

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:40.350
It's fine.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.320
What a huge reaction.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.780
How's that a huge reaction?
You were the one who pricked me suddenly.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.110
Who would make such a fuss
over something like this?

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.250
Not like you're a kid.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.070
What? A kid?

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.950
Give me your hand.
I'll prick it too.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.000
Why? I'm not sick.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.810
Gosh, look at you stepping back.

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.740
That's not stepping back,
just pulling back my hand.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.910
I'm better now.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.490
Thank you.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.110
Why are you always defending Dongha?

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.590
I'm defending him?

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.900
That's what it seems like to me.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.570
What are you talking about?

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.850
I just don't want any trouble.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.000
Is that so?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.060
Yes.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.110
Actually,
I want him to move out right away.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.500
But I can't do that.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.180
So my goal is to have him leave quietly
without causing any trouble.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.870
So help me out.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.040
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:47.920
Well.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.730
Also, don't worry.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.870
I told you. I like Han Dongha.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.650
What do you like about him?

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.030
He's kind and cute.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.210
Also...

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.620
Aren't you curious how good
his blood will taste?

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.190
Not at all!

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.430
Don't... do anything stupid.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.150
I can't guarantee that.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.320
I told you. I like Han Dongha.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.750
He's kind

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.880
and cute.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.350
How could he have gained
not even 100 grams?

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.610
Is this for real?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.810
Is the weighing scale broken?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.010
Dongha.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.770
Are you preparing to debut as an idol?

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.330
It's not to that extent.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.180
Why are you asking me to weigh myself?

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.020
Well...

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.520
Look at the slope.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520
We're worried that you'd be tired.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.240
I may not look like it,
but I'm in good health.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.700
I'm going to work.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.790
What kind of job does he do
that he doesn't gain weight?

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.710
Should we follow him?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.800
I'll go take a look.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.730
Huh?

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.390
Where's the car key?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.810
Also...

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.540
Aren't you curious how good
his blood will taste?

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.130
Absolutely not.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:03.190
Why should I trust Kang Seonjae?

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.330
Anyway, what am I even doing?

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.740
Let's just get some sleep.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.340
Can you do it by yourself?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.710
Of course.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:18.730
I can take out the trash too.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:19.880
Go back in.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.720
Thank you. See you.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.460
We're vampires.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.880
But is it right for us to learn
by watching a vampire movie?

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.040
Hey.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.050
Of all the famous directors,
there has to be one who's a vampire.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.250
This is a classic. Study it.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.610
He's here.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.940
What now?

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:03.970
What are you doing?

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.750
Don't you know simulation?

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.470
We have to succeed in it in one go.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.340
Screw that, let's just watch the movie.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.800
But...

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.590
Why is that vampire
only after human blood?

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.600
Maybe he's addicted to blood.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.740
Will I... become like this too?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.810
No way.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.050
Will I get addicted to Dongha's blood

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:39.080
and keep chasing after him
for my whole life?

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.230
What?

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.900
Let's just watch the movie.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.920
Is there anything I can help you with?

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.790
Thank you.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.670
What am I doing here?

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.130
Would you like to order?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.180
No, I'll come again next time.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.040
Okay.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:30.580
Hey! Don't you know how to pour water?

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.860
I'm sorry.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.120
Darn it!

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:37.610
Hey! I'm in a bad mood because of you.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:38.970
You have to take responsibility.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.730
Sir,
you're making things difficult for me.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:43.980
Hey!

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:46.670
You have to take responsibility!

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.240
Hyung...

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.340
Let's go.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.040
I'm working though.

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:14.560
But still, how could you do that?

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.370
It was so frustrating. Why?

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.200
I just started this job not long ago,
and now I'm going to get fired.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.500
I'll take responsibility, so stop nagging.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.160
Take responsibility of what?

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:29.930
How are you going to do that?
