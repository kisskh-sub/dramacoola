[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 7]

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.540
Mr. Lee.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.460
I've got the ship ticket
to China Hong Kong

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.260
for tomorrow night.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.380
There were too many people
buying.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.020
Sorry for being late.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.020
It's okay.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.380
Mr. Lee, you're leaving?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.380
Yes.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.210
Actually, today

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.740
I came to say goodbye to you.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.020
This last glass of wine...

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.690
Thank you.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.260
Let it be regarded as

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.010
our farewell drink.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.660
Why?

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.820
Actually,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.850
I don't want to leave either.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.060
But what's the point of me staying?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.980
My code has already been leaked.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.570
Mr. Lee!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.820
Do you know what you just said?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.500
No one present is allowed to leave.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.060
Mr. Lee, may I ask,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.540
where did you learn
the code had been leaked?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.850
From the British.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.410
Director William?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.660
Why would they tell you?

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.060
Director William has been
my friend for many years.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.660
He couldn't bear to see me implicated,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.980
so he told me.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.820
Actually, Mr. Takeda,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.100
I hadn't planned to bring this up today.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.660
But for the sake of our brotherhood,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.540
I'll give you one piece of advice.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.260
Replace my code immediately

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.820
to prevent further leaks.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.130
How did they know about it?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.500
There are many people in the MSS.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.540
It's not impossible
for the code to be leaked.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.500
Impossible.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.500
The confidentiality level
of our code is extremely high.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.980
All personnel involved
in classified matters

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.340
have never had
any contact with outsiders.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.660
If Mr. Lee is so certain

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.100
that the code has been leaked,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.540
then I can't help but suspect you.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.780
Shut up!

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.450
Takeda.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.500
You are blatantly insulting me!

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.260
This code set

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.570
is my life's work.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.410
Why would I ever leak it

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.540
and destroy my own honor?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.410
Clearly, it's the MSS

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.660
that has a mole

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.980
who ruined my work!

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.340
We must take responsibility
for your work.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.780
I will have to ask you
and everyone present

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.460
to come back with me to the MSS.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.460
Come in.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.250
Take them all away.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.460
Come in.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.100
Wait.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.340
If I can accompany her

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.170
to London

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.850
in my lifetime,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.340
it would surely be a wonderful journey.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.490
Your napkin fell.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.900
Thank you.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.490
This is to thank Mr. Lee
for his goodwill.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.610
In the name of
my foster father, I swear

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.020
I have never done anything

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.140
to betray the Empire of Japan.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.370
Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.370
Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.700
The Tonoji family.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.610
They are close aides to the Emperor.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.580
You never told me you had

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.140
such a distinguished background.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.170
But I've never heard

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.930
that Grand Duke Tonoji had a foster son.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.580
Mr. Takeda,

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.290
do you really think that
without this connection,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.930
I would have traveled
such a long way to Shanghai

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.050
to work for you?

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.250
With my foster father's status,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.700
would he have to inform you

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.930
about adopting a foster son?

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.020
I will verify

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:05.610
these words.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.020
Verify?

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:09.810
I bear the expectations and mission

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.490
of Grand Duke Tonoji to save East Asia.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.140
I traveled thousands of miles
to work for you.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.050
And now,

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.810
you doubt my loyalty?

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.490
This is not only an insult to me,

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.250
but also to my foster father!

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.810
Mr. Lee, I absolutely did not mean

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.700
to insult Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.810
Fine.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.140
Don't you want to verify?

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:33.490
No problem.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.020
I'll give you the chance to verify.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.170
Now,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.490
send a coded telegram,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.700
pretending to order an air strike
on Chinese forces

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.250
around Shanghai.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:42.020
If the enemy camps

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.050
make no response at all,

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.290
we'll all be happy.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.050
You'll lose nothing.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.290
On the contrary,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.020
if it turns out that my code

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.050
has been leaked completely,

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.140
you'll still have time to remedy it.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.370
Otherwise, all future losses

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.810
on the battlefield
for the Empire of Japan

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.490
will be your responsibility.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.370
Mr. Lee,

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.490
a code leak is not a joke.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:23.020
Even if Grand Duke Tonoji
came himself today,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.490
I would not conduct
such an absurd test.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.480
[10 minutes until the scheduled time]

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.730
Gu Yangshan.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.930
I will keep monitoring Unit 153's radio.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.460
If they still haven't sent

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.610
the test coded message
for the air raid at 8,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.610
then the charge of
falsifying military orders

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.930
will leave us to
die an ignominious death.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:01.810
I've said all I could.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.930
I see you as my brother,

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.700
yet you treat me as a mole.

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.140
Then I can only give you four words.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:13.460
Act responsibly.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.490
Charlie.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.810
Mr. Lee, I'm here.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.370
How can a good actor

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:28.610
make the audience believe

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.250
what he plays is real?

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:44.770
By making the fake real.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.850
Mr. Lee!

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.130
Be careful, Mr. Takeda.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.340
Mr. Lee, are you alright?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.220
Go now.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.850
Call for reinforcements.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:41.250
Leave!

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.730
Under the window,
our people will be there to assist.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.650
Murder!

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.850
What happened?

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.250
Sorry, Mr. Lee.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.730
I failed to keep you safe.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:06.250
Mr. Takeda,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.010
what are you standing there for?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.850
Call an ambulance!

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.130
Mr. Takeda.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.490
This is a standard dagger
from the BIS.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:15.850
Also,

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.420
we found this.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.130
Mr. Takeda,

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.890
we have both witness
and physical evidence.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:26.420
This waiter

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.010
was sent by the BIS
to kill Mr. Lee.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.730
Mr. Lee has worked wholeheartedly

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.130
for the Empire of Japan.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.770
Mr. Takeda,
do you still not believe him?

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.250
What a small accident indeed.

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.730
Hurry and call an ambulance!

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.730
Mr. Takeda,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:54.610
Mr. Lee is a friend
of the Empire of Japan.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.370
He almost died at the hands
of an anti-Japanese fighter.

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.130
If anything happens here today,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.250
who can bear that responsibility?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.490
Mr. Lee.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.490
I will take full responsibility

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:19.220
for everything that happened here.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.340
Wait here for a moment.

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.890
Get rid of this guy.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.370
Pass the message to Mr. Aota.

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.730
Is that Mr. Aota?

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.850
I'd like to ask you a favor.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.130
Appreciated.

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:01.730
This is Takeda.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.700
Mr. Takeda.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.940
We've already sent the air raid order

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.940
to the Air Force Unit 153.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.300
Unfortunately,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.220
the Nationalist Army's 405th Battalion

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.730
immediately sounded
the air raid alarm at 20:00.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.730
Gu Yangshan, well played!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.850
Thank you.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.580
I traveled all this way to work for you,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.700
yet you suspected me
over and over again.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.100
Today I've ended up
in such a wretched state.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.460
I was so wrong to trust you.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.580
Mr. Lee is right.

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.340
What we did was wrong.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.100
We are left with no choice
but to doubt everyone.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.100
Mr. Lee.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.220
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.580
Take Mr. Lee to the hospital.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.940
Yes, this is Kobayashi.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.220
Yes.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.100
Mr. Takeda.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.700
What is it?

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.490
The Communist base has also
sounded the air raid alarm.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.460
I said take Mr. Lee
to the hospital first.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.460
Yes.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.980
Mr. Lee, there are steps.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.220
Mr. Lee, I'll leave you to them.

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:23.140
Yes.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.180
Was tonight's event

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.940
arranged in advance by you?

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.460
Why didn't you tell me beforehand?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.940
We were afraid
Takeda wouldn't believe you,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.740
so we arranged the assassination.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.180
If you didn't act real enough,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.660
Takeda wouldn't believe you.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.460
We did this

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:40.740
all for your own good.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.260
For my good?

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.180
For my good,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.900
you had Gu killed?

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.460
Gu Yangshan, if you don't trust me,

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.700
why did you get me
to do this in the first place?

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.220
Now look.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.700
Because of your mistrust,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.220
you got Gu killed.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.220
Gu Yangshan, are you even human?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.940
Do you think I would have

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.740
sent Gu to his death?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.180
Uncle Gu was a soldier,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.500
but he was more like my family.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.460
I couldn't stop him
from going to the battlefield,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.980
but who would ever
send their own family

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.530
to their death?

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.290
No, absolutely not.

00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:45.050
Uncle Gu, please don't
try to persuade me.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:45.530
Otherwise...

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.570
Young Master, your identity
is not appropriate.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.370
If someone must go, I'll go.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.090
You? With that leg of yours?

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.050
Your leg...

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.900
Don't hesitate.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.420
This is the best plan.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.940
Don't forget.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.220
I'm not only a servant
of the Gu family,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.220
I'm also a soldier.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.180
If your identity is exposed,

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.700
then Ding Yi will be doomed.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.660
He needs you more.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.220
Uncle Gu, how about this.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.570
After we pretend to fight,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.530
I'll knock you to the window,

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:36.180
then push you out.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.700
There'll be our people
below to catch you.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.090
Once they catch you,

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.770
they'll take you to the dock.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.980
You get on a ship immediately.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.570
Once things calm down,

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:49.460
I'll come find you.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.220
Tonight's plan was

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.700
after Uncle Gu's assassination attempt,
he'd jump from the window.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.610
Then he would be taken to the dock
by the people waiting below,

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.460
and immediately leave.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.500
We already agreed on this.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.020
But...

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.260
Why didn't he do it?

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.090
He promised me.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.610
He promised that.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.260
But Ding Yi,

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.980
I'm telling you.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.220
In tonight's plan,

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.220
whether it was me or Uncle Gu who died,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.260
we never intended for you to die.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.460
I promised you,

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:50.460
if there's danger,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.700
I'll stand in front of you.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.940
I will never lie about that.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:29.370
One, two, three, smile.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.530
Take care.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.020
Go.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:40.350
Hey.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:44.570
Look at you.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.810
I said take care.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.530
Get up.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:53.290
Was Gu

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.180
our comrade?

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.770
Comrade Xiao.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.610
Takeda is naturally suspicious.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.570
Ding Yi's combat experience

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.850
is not very rich.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.610
I feared that

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.370
Ding Yi couldn't convince Takeda,

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.050
so I decided to leave him

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:24.740
a backup plan.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.330
I need to assassinate
Joseph Lee at the banquet,

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.370
so that the Japanese
would believe his loyalty.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.530
Only then

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:38.330
could they stop suspecting him.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.290
I know this is a road of no return.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:57.810
But as long as
Joseph Lee's code remains,

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.050
thousands of miles
of territory will be lost.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:05.530
I've stayed by Gu Zhengze's side,

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.980
lying low for many years.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.740
Now it's become a dead game.

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.290
If I can make a contribution
at this time of national crisis,

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:23.500
then I can die without regret.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:27.290
Please forgive me
for not informing you earlier.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.940
Ding Yi is a good child.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.530
Let me

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.020
see him off one last time.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.570
Dear comrades,

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:44.530
farewell forever.

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.760
[Sasaki, Colonel of MSS]

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.740
This is

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.980
a sakura sapling

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.330
I brought from Tokyo.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.220
They all say

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.530
that Japanese cherry blossoms

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.530
cannot survive

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.570
on Chinese soil.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.460
But I don't believe it.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.050
I think

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:43.700
as long as we find the right method,

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:46.980
Japanese cherry blossoms

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.290
can also bloom beautifully
on Chinese land.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.050
It's my incompetence.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.330
Before I take my own life,

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.050
I have only one request.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.020
Takeda,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.530
what mistake did you make?

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.740
It was my negligence at work

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:30.050
that led to Joseph Lee's code
being leaked.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.530
I must take responsibility
for the failure

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.980
in the intelligence war.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.500
That's true.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:46.810
A unit professionally trained
in intelligence

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.290
spent a huge amount

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:51.090
to develop a code system.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:53.770
But in the end,

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:57.090
it came to nothing.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.810
I'm sorry, Colonel.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.330
It's my incompetence.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:11.050
I'm willing to atone with my life.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.740
Takeda.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.330
A samurai's dignity is only for show.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.330
Killing you

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:31.460
will not recover the losses
already caused.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.700
Death is easy,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.530
but what you need to do now

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.530
is to make amends.

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.290
I've always suspected

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.050
that Joseph Lee had a problem.

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:09.530
But he claimed to be
the foster son of Grand Duke Tonoji.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:17.740
He has a photo
of the Grand Duke holding him.

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.530
Because of this identity,

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:25.980
I didn't dare to detain
and interrogate him rashly.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.500
Joseph Lee's father

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.530
once served

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:35.220
as Grand Duke Tonoji's math teacher.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.290
I checked it

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.980
when Grand Duke

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.330
recommended him.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.050
As for the foster son matter...

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.940
Colonel, you mean...

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.290
If you're concerned about this identity,

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.740
then just find someone unaffected by it.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:16.220
China has no emperor.

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:19.770
These people fight their own battles.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.500
Each of them

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:28.330
has their own
little secrets and schemes.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.500
Dealing with them requires skills.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.980
We must learn to use the Chinese ways
to control the Chinese.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:45.220
Make good use of these Chinese friends.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.330
You mean, let the Chinese
investigate the Chinese?

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.570
As they themselves say,

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.500
"Sit back and watch the tigers fight."

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.290
Sit back and watch the tigers fight.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.530
Once the code is changed,

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.460
Baimahu will definitely be safe, right?

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:50.290
It will be safe.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.570
Have you eaten?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.420
Shall I get you some breakfast?

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.090
Don't bother.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.980
None of us know the true relationship

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.330
between Grand Duke Tonoji
and Joseph Lee.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.810
I worry that your bluff

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.260
will be exposed before long.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.330
So I arranged tonight's ship

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.330
to send you to China Hong Kong.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.290
There will also be people going
to Baimahu to get your mother.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:30.700
You'll reunite in China Hong Kong.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.980
So it ends here.

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:42.530
The play's over.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.810
The people should be dispersed.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.460
What's wrong? Unhappy?

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.090
I'm not unhappy.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.740
I'm happy.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.460
There maybe

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.460
an even bigger stage waiting for me.

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:04.770
Here, this is your passport.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:05.530
Keep it safe.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.260
The money is all in the trunk.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.700
It should be enough for you
to live well for some time.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.770
Also, I wish that on this new stage,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.530
you'll get to play the role you desire.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.330
Where are you going?

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.530
Chaosheng Theatre.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.740
To say goodbye to everyone.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.530
The organization has already agreed

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:50.980
to let the troupe members
evacuate first.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.700
Good.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.330
I've already spoken to everyone.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:55.940
Tomorrow, under the excuse of a tour,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.290
we'll send them
to the countryside to hide for a while.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.940
They'll come back
once the danger has passed.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.050
Where are you going?

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.700
To Chaosheng Theatre, to thank Ms. Xian.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:27.090
This time we made a great success.

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:28.330
Those Japanese

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:29.530
and the BIS

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.810
will surely keep an eye on us.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.810
Before trouble comes knocking,

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.460
we'll leave right after
tonight's performance.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:17.730
Biyun.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:19.860
I understand how you feel.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.690
After all, you founded
this troupe yourself.

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.980
You don't want to see it
destroyed in your hands.

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.340
But,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.300
ever since we agreed to help Ding Yi,

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.050
you should've been prepared for this.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.820
Besides,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.570
as long as we protect our members,

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.460
one day

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.050
we'll form a new troupe.

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.730
The foreigners are all evacuating.

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.340
The Concession
is getting more dangerous.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.340
We have a base near Kunshan.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.780
It should ensure everyone's safety.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:01.780
Go pick up Ding Yi.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.380
Have him withdraw with the troupe.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.130
Also,

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.340
Hongyu's Party membership application

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:09.340
can be put on the agenda.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.340
Alright.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.340
Biyun.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.730
You are...

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.940
Why's it so lively?

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.730
Ms. Xian Biyun is here, right?

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:21.780
Who is this woman?

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.300
Ye Yin.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.130
Ye Yin?

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.380
I know her.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.690
She is the wife of Liang Jingyuan
from Suzhou BIS.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.460
Mr. Takeda.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.530
What did the Colonel say?

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.420
Liang Jingyuan's wife, Ye Yin
from Suzhou BIS,

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.570
indirectly hinted to us

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.610
that the code might have been leaked.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:58.130
Did you question her
about the source of her information?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.980
It was the same story as Joseph Lee's.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.500
She also heard it from the British.

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:06.570
At Director William's farewell banquet,

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.690
I used her

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.730
to leak the news to the Japanese

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.730
that Joseph Lee's code
had been compromised.

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.500
I've heard that

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.380
the code Joseph Lee designed
for the Japanese

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.980
has already been leaked to the British.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.050
Really?

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.340
So I thought,

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.820
if you could promptly pass this news

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.610
to Chairman Wang,

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.690
maybe

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.500
Liang will be sent back.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.420
That's a good idea.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.130
Many years ago,
I saved Liang Jingyuan's life,

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.860
but he never knew my real identity.

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:50.300
Judging by things now,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.210
it's likely he'll be placed in
the Special Agent Headquarters.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.460
Maybe getting close to Ye Yin

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.210
will be a good chance
to get intelligence.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:03.820
Isn't Xian Biyun very close
with the British?

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.500
Ever since Joseph Lee
went to Chaosheng Theatre that night,

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.690
things started getting strange.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.340
I should have investigated earlier.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.940
But if we investigate her,

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:24.500
will Mr. Lee allow it?

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.050
We can have the police station
in the Concession

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.820
investigate Chaosheng Troupe.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.610
As for Xian Biyun herself...

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.050
Wait.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.610
Hasn't Liang Jingyuan

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.130
always wanted a position

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.130
in our new government?

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.210
Tell his wife that
if this matter is clarified,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.610
I will give him a satisfactory position.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.420
Yes.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.940
Ms. Xian, your guest has arrived.

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:58.500
Biyun.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.420
Take this.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:00.050
Alright.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.500
Mrs. Liang, you shouldn't have

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.570
brought so many gifts.

00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:04.050
It's only right.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.650
Such a big movie star like you

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:08.980
is still doing your own bookkeeping?

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.980
So many accounts to balance.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:13.250
If you don't keep
the accounts straight,

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.570
who'll feed all these people?

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.130
This is my first time
visiting the troupe.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.530
It's quite interesting.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:26.020
And you really have this place

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.460
set up well.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.250
What's got you so happy?

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.090
Come inside and talk.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.500
Sit.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.650
I came here specifically to thank you.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.090
Remember the Japanese

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:44.250
code leak?

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.610
When I told the Japanese,

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:48.860
they didn't believe it.

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.610
They said,

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.460
"Our code has
the highest level of secrecy,

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.690
so it's impossible for it to leak."

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:55.570
They made a fool of themselves.

00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:59.460
But,

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.940
how did you hear from the British

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.380
such confidential information?

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.500
Look at the way you're asking.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:11.460
It's like our two families
both sell medicine,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.530
but you insist on asking
for our secret recipe.

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:14.860
Is that appropriate?

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.020
Liang said the same thing.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.420
But we know what to do.

00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:25.170
When the Japanese asked,

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.900
we just said it came from the British.

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.050
Didn't mention you at all.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:31.900
Oh, there's another reason I came today.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:34.020
I've been away
from Shanghai for so long,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.570
I don't know what's trending

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.860
here now.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.130
Do you have time today?

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.380
Come with me for a stroll.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.340
I can't today.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.130
Look at all these accounts
I have to settle.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:47.130
I can't even finish them.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.090
I do bookkeeping too.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.340
One more day won't hurt.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.020
Stop that.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.530
Next time.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:55.340
Next time I'll go shopping with you.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:56.980
There won't be a next time.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.380
Liang is coming back to Shanghai.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.050
Congratulations to him.

Tell them they can take action now.

[Li Boyao, Inspector of Police Station]
Yes, there is such a place.

Don't worry, Sir.

Get ready to go.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:25.250
Do they own the road?

00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:18.210
Stop!

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:19.730
Don't move!

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:20.250
What's going on?

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.130
What are you doing?

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:22.540
Director, the script is changed again?

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:24.900
What's this about?

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.770
All of you are such a ragtag bunch.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.420
We're in rehearsal,
don't cause trouble.

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.610
Shut up!

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.090
The police are doing their job!

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:37.420
Someone reported to us

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.940
that someone in Chaosheng Troupe
is hiding opium!

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:41.730
We are here by order
to search and arrest people.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:43.130
Everyone will be taken away.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.170
Mr. Wu.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.570
Hongyu.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:01.860
What should we do?

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:02.820
Mr. Wu.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.540
Hongyu, listen to me.

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:06.770
The organization
has already arranged it.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.340
Take the earliest train
tomorrow morning to Kunshan.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.380
Find Mr. Qi from Qi's Pharmacy.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.090
Tell him

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:12.730
to immediately send people

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:13.820
here to pick us up.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.420
What about you, Mr. Wu?

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.090
Don't worry about us, just go!

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.730
Go, be careful.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.420
Take care.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:23.940
Remember, Qi's Pharmacy.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.250
What are you doing?

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:28.940
Take him away!

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:29.250
Yes!

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.650
Go!

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:30.650
Alright.
