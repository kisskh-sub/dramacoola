[Love Conspiracy]

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.600
[Adapted from Enhenzhai's novel,
Madam, No Mercy for Scum]

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.500
[Episode 8]

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.590
The best solution right now

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.040
is for Nie Xiaofei to admit

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.590
she and Yi Wenhan are in a relationship.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.640
Mom.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.100
You're not

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.460
making me admit
that Wenhan and I are together, are you?

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.580
Xiaofei,

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.980
you heard it.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.500
I'm just stuck in this mess.
I have no choice.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.900
How about

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.100
you take this blow?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.900
Xiaofei.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.060
You have to understand how I feel.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.260
I love you both.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.700
You're both my children.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.540
If I hadn't sent your brother
to the orphanage,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.820
neither of us would have made it
into the Song family.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.460
Xiaofei, do you even remember
how you grew up?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.180
Look at this house.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.700
You've been pampered

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.460
and lived in luxury
since you were little.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.100
And your brother?

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.300
He had nothing

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.220
in that orphanage.
He endured everyone's scorn.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.340
It breaks my heart

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.660
to think how much he suffered.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.060
So much pain.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.260
Xiaofei, we owe him.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.660
There's nothing I can do
to help him now.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.900
That's why I'm begging you.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.260
Xiaofei.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.300
Please, help your brother.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.060
But you're only

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.580
thinking about him!

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.060
What about me, Mom?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.540
If this gets out,

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.940
what happens to my career?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.100
Who would ever hire me again?

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.660
And my reputation, my future.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.940
If people find out

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.660
he's my brother,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.260
my entire life will be ruined!

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.500
Yes, Xiaofei.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.060
I understand everything you're saying.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.380
I'm also a woman.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.420
I spoke out of panic and impulse.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.340
Xiaofei, I won't force you.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.220
Let's analyze it calmly.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.500
Let's figure out a solution.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.980
Let's have a good discussion.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.280
[He's so gentle. Nie Xiaofei
must have seduced him.]

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.000
[Without solid proof, Yi Wenhan
is innocent. She's framing him.]

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.420
Xiaofei,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.700
I've been thinking.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.540
Something about these recent events

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.660
feels off.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.220
You showed me
the comments online earlier.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.460
Everyone was on your side.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.100
Why did they
suddenly shift toward Wenhan?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.540
And

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.740
wasn't your whole plan

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.180
meant to trap Song Zhizhi?

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.700
How did she end up turning it around?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.060
The strangest part is the tableware.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.420
Hotel tableware

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.820
is always cleaned after use.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.220
Why wasn't it washed that day?

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.340
As if it was left there on purpose.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.420
I feel like the public opinion online

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.180
is being manipulated,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.300
shifting back and forth.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.700
Who's behind it?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:00.980
Who could it be?

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.780
Exactly.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.100
Who could it be?

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.220
Song Zhizhi.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.860
Mom, it must be Song Zhizhi.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.300
She's always had it out for me.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.540
She's always stood in my way!

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.460
She's the one trying to
ruin me and my brother!

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.500
Yes, sweetie.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.380
You're so clever.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.660
It's her!

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.620
No one else would do this.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.220
She's always seen you
as a thorn in her side.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.980
I blame myself
for being too soft-hearted back then.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.260
Bullying my children?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.180
I won't let them off!

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.980
So, Xiaofei,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.020
do you understand now?

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.380
Protecting your brother

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.540
means protecting yourself.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.500
You need to listen to me.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.220
I only want what's best for you.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.100
Thank you,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.900
sweetie.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.500
Thank you.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.820
Mr. Yi is here!

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.140
- Mr. Yi.
- Mr. Yi.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.500
Could you give us a quick interview?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.300
Would you mind answering
a few questions, Mr. Yi?

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.620
Mr. Yi, are you dating both Song Zhizhi

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.300
and Nie Xiaofei at the same time?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.660
There are rumors that you often use

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.060
such drugs for fun. Is that true?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.900
Mr. Yi, was filing the police report

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.180
part of a plan you two had?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.060
Yes, could you answer it?

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.140
Please answer the question.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.900
We need a response, please.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.180
Please answer our questions.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.580
Mr. Yi, please tell us.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.580
Wenhan.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.060
- Miss Nie?
- Miss Nie?

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.820
Wenhan,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.380
I'm here to take you home.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.460
This was all my fault.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.380
Let's not fight anymore.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:10.740
Alright?

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.980
Thank you all for your concern.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.380
This was all a misunderstanding.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.180
Wenhan and I
are currently in a relationship.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.500
We apologize
for the unnecessary attention

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.180
this private matter has attracted.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.700
Lastly, I want to apologize once more

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.140
for my recklessness.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.220
I'm sorry.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:07:59.940
Xiaofei,

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.740
when did you and Yi Wenhan get together?

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.500
Did you not know

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.780
he's your sister's ex-boyfriend?

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.300
We've had such a falling-out with him.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.980
Why would you still be with him?

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.500
Dad,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.580
it's precisely because I knew

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.140
about Zhizhi and Wenhan's history

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.260
that I was afraid to tell you

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.740
and everyone else.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.980
Look at you.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.500
There are so many good men out there.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.340
Why did you have to pick a scumbag?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.140
Xiaofei, what is wrong with you?

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.180
If you wanted to date,
you could have done it properly.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.820
Why cause such a scene?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.980
I just

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.980
acted rashly. I didn't

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.260
think it through.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.580
What did you say?

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.900
Didn't think it through?

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.740
Do you even realize

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.100
the Song family is being gossiped about
because of you?

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.660
People are saying I let my daughter

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.540
stage everything just for publicity!

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.180
Honey,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.620
all that stuff online

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.020
is just nonsense.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:05.980
Don't believe it.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.500
Don't be mad.
Your health is what matters.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.300
How did our family end up

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.940
with a disgraceful girl like you?

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.860
Starting tomorrow,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.980
you're leaving the industry.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:21.100
You should go.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.340
Leave the Song family.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.380
Dad.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.140
Dad, I... I know I was wrong.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.980
If I had known this would happen,

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.780
I'd never have dragged
our family into it.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:33.980
How could you not drag us into it?

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.100
Your leaving

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.820
is the only way to make a clean break.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.780
Mom, help me.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.780
Honey,

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.140
if you kick Xiaofei out,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.420
I can't stay

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.420
in this house either.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.700
I can't take care of you anymore.

I know you wouldn't.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.140
How can I rest easy at home

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.860
knowing she's out there

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.100
with nowhere to go?

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.660

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.820

and go abroad to study.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.540
Mom, what did you say?

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.500
Don't call me Mom!

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.020
All these years,

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.580
I've taught you to study
and be well-mannered.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.980
What happened to all that?

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.740
What else can you do
besides cause trouble?

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.780
I'm so disappointed in you.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.540
Go upstairs

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.220

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.540
Mom, I know I was wrong.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.100
I'm begging you,

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.100
don't make me go abroad.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.500
Don't make me
leave the modeling industry.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.740
Please, Mom.

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.740
If you truly know you were wrong,
then listen to your dad.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.180
Go abroad and reflect on yourself.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.540
Dad.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.940
I think it might be improper

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:42.860
to send Xiaofei abroad right now.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.700
Everyone has their eyes on us now.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.380
If the media gets wind of this
and starts speculating,

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.740
it could hurt
our family's reputation even more.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:56.580
We do owe the public

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.340
and our shareholders an explanation.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.220
But Dad,

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.260
you've already suspended
Xiaofei's endorsements.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.900
I'm her sister.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.860
I'll share the burden for her.

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:14.820
Dad,

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.540
I promise you,

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.220
in the coming days,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.020
I'll restore the public's

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.860
and the shareholders' faith
in the Song family.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.900
Please don't punish Xiaofei too harshly.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.820
I'll let it slide this time,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.420
but only because of your mom

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.140

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.980
If there's a next time,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.540
you'll leave the Song family for good.

Don't ruin your health over this.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.820

Aunt Wenzhi, don't blame Xiaofei

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.620
but he's actually despicable.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.180

Hey, what's up?

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:53.340
Hey, Ji.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.220
Sorry about that.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.860
Let me wipe it for you.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:57.820
It's fine.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.340
I've got it. I'll handle this.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:00.820
Don't...

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.260
Ji, what's going on with you two?

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.940
Ji.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.020
What's the situation here?

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.260
I... I should go.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.900
I wasn't talking to you.

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.660
I'll come see you.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.700
Weren't you supposed to be fishing
for information?

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.380
Why did it sound like

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:39.220
something else was going on
over the phone,

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.260
Ji?

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.580
No, that's not right.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.020
You look off.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:44.940
Tell me

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.460
what's going on between you
and Song Zhizhi. You two...

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.020
It's nothing.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.100
I didn't even finish.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.460
You're defensive,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:51.980
aren't you?

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.060
Hello?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:05.660
Ziming.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.780
It's time for you to come back.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.540
Hello, Mr. Wei.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.740
Hi, Mr. Wei.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.820
Hello, Mr. Wei.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.420
Ziming, welcome home.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.700
Long time no see.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.540
Good thing you're back.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.540
You have no idea

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.180
how much has happened
to the company lately.

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.740
The scandal with Nie Xiaofei

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.260
caused a huge stir.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.220
Many brand partners are terminating
their contracts with us.

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.860
The public claims

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.180
that we are maliciously creating hype

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.540
and betraying their trust.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.460
I've already come up

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.580
with a new PR plan before returning.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.700
What we need to do now

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.420
is fight fire with fire.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.340
By the way, Ziming,

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.340
there's one more thing
I need your help with.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.820
Mr. Wei, you're back.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.780
Mr. Song, here are the documents
you asked for.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.580
I'll leave them here.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.300
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.700
Mr. Liu, wait.

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.100
Mr. Liu,

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.900
you've worked hard

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.740
all these years taking care of my dad.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.140
Not just with company matters,

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.580
but also his daily life.

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.220
You've been thorough and dedicated.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.100
Today,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.940
I'd like to invite you for tea.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.660
Mr. Song, you're too kind.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.060
Thanks for your hard work, Mr. Liu.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.300
Please, have some tea.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:56.540
Thank you, Mr. Wei.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:05.860
It's too hot.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.300
Now it's not.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.140
Drink.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.020
Why aren't you drinking?

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.260
Isn't this the same tea
my dad drinks every day?

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.700
Dad,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.260
your medical report shows

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.340
there's a kind of chronic toxin
in your body.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.540
The water and food at home are all fine.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.980
I've been wondering
what could be the cause.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.820
So I had

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.020
your daily tea tested.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:58.660
Turns out,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.580
the toxin comes from this.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:12.860
Mr. Liu,

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.140
we've already called the police.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.060
You'll face justice.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.220
Mr. Song, I...

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.220
Mr. Liu.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.100
You've been by my side for years.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.940
I've always treated you well.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.940
Why would you harm me?

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.180
Hello?

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.060
Lately, the constant negative press

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.700
has made the board
very unhappy with the Song family.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.900
Keep a close watch.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.860
Report to me if anything comes up.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:03.580

I'll make sure they lose theirs as well.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.020

Uncle Song,

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.180
I've been abroad for years

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:26.860
and couldn't look after you

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:28.300
or Zhizhi.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.900
So many things have happened lately.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.140
I'm sorry.

Oh, don't say that.

Yeah, I called you back
to help with the company.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.500
But it's also because
I haven't seen you for ages.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.420
What my dad means is,
he really missed you.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.740
He talks about you often at home.

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.020
I know.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.500
Ever since you adopted me,

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:53.620
I've felt responsible

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.940
for you,

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.820

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.500
and Zhizhi.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.460
No more of this "adopt" talk.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.460
From the moment you joined us,

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.660
you've been like a real son to me.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.020
Come on, eat up.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.740
That's right, Ziming.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:12.020
You, Zhizhi, and Xiaofei

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.540
are all your father's children.

Xiaofei

really hasn't considered
our family's interests.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.420
Honey,

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:25.660
you're right.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.740
Xiaofei is

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:29.260
too reckless.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.180

a bit too mild?

Hello?

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.220
I saw what you pulled off.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.860

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.300
This has already attracted
a lot of attention.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.500
The public's focus

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.540
has shifted from the gossip
about Starlight Jewelry

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.340
to the auction.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.460
Hope this auction

00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:31.380
can turn things around for the company.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:34.860
Ziming,

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.540
we'll make this work!

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:39.740
