[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 21]

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.670
No, Mother, there's still more here.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.390
Hongdou!

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.230
What happened to this wound?

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.830
A bad dog scratched Mother.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.870
Enough.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.070
What dog?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.560
Mother's always like this.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.560
She says it's dog scratches. Bad dog.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.950
Hongdou,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.120
they just made tasty little cakes
in the kitchen.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.640
Why don't you go try one? Go on.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.790
Didn't you say

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.150
you've been doing well all these years?

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.480
I have been doing well.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.480
Liar.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.310
Why does it matter?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.910
It was my own choice.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.870
Why do you keep rejecting me?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.310
If it's because of Hongdou,

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.680
I promise

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.280
I'll treat her like my own daughter.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.430
Would you really

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.960
have her face a father who's moody

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.710
and might beat people at any time?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.960
It has nothing to do with you.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.310
How does it not?

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.870
We...

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.750
There's nothing between us.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.710
I'm someone with one foot in the grave.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560
Why should I have anything
to do with you?

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.080
Who would've thought

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560
that carefree little girl

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.630
would suddenly

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.030
become such an independent woman?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.910
Ce,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.870
you've changed too.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.240
Look, with our years of friendship,

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.560
think again about working together.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.120
Sorry, Ce.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.560
No matter when,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.750
I'll always stand by Pei.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
Are you sure you'd abandon
your own father

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.120
for the sake of a man?

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.070
And how good a father he was,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.750
you of all people should know, Ce.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.120
Chu Yan,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.750
think carefully.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.920
Jiang City is my turf.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.160
No need to scare me.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.480
I didn't get through all these years
for nothing.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.360
She does have ability.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.800
None of my people

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.630
could uncover Jiu's background.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.680
Better not make her an enemy now.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.480
See?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.160
I've circled back to business again.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.600
It's a bad habit.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.560
Inviting you and Pei home today

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.630
was just for a meal,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.430
to catch up.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.160
There's plenty of time.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.070
We'll have a chance to cooperate.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.920
Let's go.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.680
Pei,

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.070
where are you going?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.560
Tongpei,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.310
the meal's almost ready.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.560
Are you leaving?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.950
Uncle.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.430
Uncle,

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.720
did you argue with Father?

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.630
No, we were just playing around.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.800
Stop playing. Eat with me.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.160
Okay.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.870
Here's to Miss Chu.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.560
Hongdou, come here.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.720
Mother's hands aren't well.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.560
Let me feed you.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.040
Hongdou,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.360
I haven't had time
to eat with you lately.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.830
Do you blame me?

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.560
Hongdou, behave nicely with Father.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.040
Don't get food all over him.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.160
Mother, it's good. Try it.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.680
Hongdou, is it good?

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.160
Thank you, Pei.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.560
What a loving family.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.560
I'm envious.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.430
You can have one too.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.240
You've kept Miss Chu
waiting long enough.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.120
It's about time you made it official.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.430
I'll think about it.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.240
Chu Yan's waited for me all these years.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.120
I've come to realize

00:07:59.000 --> 00:07:59.800
that one

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.240
must keep moving forward.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.870
Then I'll be waiting for your good news.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.310
Rest assured, Tongpei,

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.720
I'll throw you a grand celebration.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.920
Then I should visit you
more often, Minghui.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.310
You're experienced

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:15.630
and can teach me a lot.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920
Sure.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.950
Hongdou.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.360
You have a butterfly on your forehead.
It's so pretty.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.910
Thank you, Hongdou.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.000
Here.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.630
Thank you.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:06.870
Hongdou,

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.630
it's Aunt.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.320
You sound even more eager than I am.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.270
It's only a matter of time.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.150
Yes,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.480
it's just a matter of time. Here.

Tongpei, Chu Yan,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.120
I still have official duties

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.840
and won't see you off.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.600
Don't worry.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.270
Hongdou, see you.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.080
Hongdou, say goodbye to Aunt.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.510
Bye-bye.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:43.220

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.620

They are a good match,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.670
just like us,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.000
aren't they?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.510
You helped Gu Tongpei so much,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.630
yet he chose someone else in the end.

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.120
No wonder though.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.910
Chu Yan is better than you now.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.150
No wonder he gave up on you,
a sickly burden.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.030
Pei,

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.750
you've finally agreed to be with me.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.240
Let's get married, shall we?

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.360
Do you prefer a Chinese-style
or Western-style wedding?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.870
The wedding dress needs
to be ordered in advance.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.120
We can go abroad for our honeymoon

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.550
and travel together.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.630
It has nothing to do with you.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.120
How does it not?

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.750
We...

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.630
There's nothing between us.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.550
Pei,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.270
what's wrong?

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.320
Chu Yan,

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:11.270
what did you just say?

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.360
I was asking

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.960
when we'll get married.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.630
Many things need
to be prepared in advance.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.240
Chu Yan...

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.240
I'm sorry.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.960
What

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.720
is so good about her?

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:40.550
I'm sorry.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.510
I know

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.030
I still have a lot to improve.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.320
But it doesn't matter.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.840
I can change little by little.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:52.670
Chu Yan,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.320
you don't have to.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.240
You can keep loving Chu Minghui.

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.550
I can also keep chasing you.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.360
I'll get off here.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.320
See you.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.960
Chu Yan!

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.480
Mother.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.120
Hongdou.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.080
Where have you been?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.750
I wanted to ride a big horse,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.030
but Father is busy.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:15.510
I'll play with you. Let's go.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.720
No,

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.750
you'll hurt.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.750
What a sweet girl.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.750
You care about me.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:27.480
Hongdou,

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:29.120
let me ask you,

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.120
if one day...

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.630
If one day I'm not by your side,

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:39.240
would you be willing

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.240
to live with Uncle and Aunt?

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.120
Why will Uncle be together with Aunt?

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.200
Because

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.870
they'll marry

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.510
and become a family.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.750
Why will they get married?

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.910
Because they love each other.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.240
But Uncle doesn't like Aunt.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.120
I don't like milk,

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.870
so you don't make me drink it.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.320
Aunt doesn't like shrimp,

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.440
but Uncle still gave her shrimp.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.670
Have more.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.440
Yes, Hongdou?

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.960
Mother,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.080
I like Uncle.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.320
I don't want him to disappear.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.840
What do you mean?

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.870
I just went to see Father

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.870
and heard Mr. Zhao Jun saying

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.870
something about a car, about a bomb...

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.960
He said Uncle

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.720
will disappear tonight.
