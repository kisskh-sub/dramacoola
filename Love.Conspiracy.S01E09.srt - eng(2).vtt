Keep it.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.580
I can't accept this.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.460
This ring holds the memories
of you and your mom.

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:26.180
So

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.220
you should keep it.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.060
Honey, I'll put your towel here.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.060
Hello?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.620
I never expected Ji Baijian

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.780
to propose in front of everyone.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.220
Though this day was bound to come.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.180
By the way,

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.900
I told you to speed things up.
How's it going?

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.540
I've already increased the dosage.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.340
But we have to do it step by step.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.740
Raising it too quickly

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.540
would leave evidence

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.020
if anyone decides to investigate.

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.660
No, we can't wait any longer.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.700
If the Song and Ji families
unite through marriage,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.860
it will be much harder for us
to get our hands on Starlight Jewelry.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.500
We can't keep Song Shan anymore.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.420
Alright, got it.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.420
He has many
underlying health conditions.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.860

won't be hard.

Why did Song Zhizhi refuse
to accept the ring?

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.380
There's no way she couldn't tell

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.420
that this ring and the rough gemstones
her family has hidden

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.500
are from the same batch.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.660
If she knew,

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:23.940
there's no reason
she wouldn't have reacted.

I thought

I could protect myself and my family

Song Shan did bid,

but he didn't compete with us.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.180
And could it be that Song Zhizhi
is not involved in this?

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.420
I let her know

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:24.020
the ring was my mom's final work.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.100
If she were involved,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.700
she wouldn't have given it back to me.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.820

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.180
have a point there.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.500
But what we can be sure of is

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.780
that the Song family

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:41.060

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.220

News about Song Shan's condition
has spread within the group.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.780
We can proceed to the next step.

If Song Zhizhi gains support
from both Ji Baijian

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.260

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.900
our plan might go wrong.

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.460
Don't worry.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.460
Most of Song Shan's equity shares

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:59.500
are managed by a trust.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.500
Combined with the shares I hold
and Nie Xiaofei's,

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:05.180
I'm ready for whatever move

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.340
Song Zhizhi makes.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.580
Besides, I've been going to
the company frequently lately.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:13.580
I've already secured
some internal support

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.460
for Yi Wenhan.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.260
We need to move faster.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.020
I'm afraid delays
might cause complications.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.380
I'm even more in a hurry than you are.

00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.980
After all,

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.340
we're at the most crucial point now.

Maybe you could stay
with my dad for a while?

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.420
Don't worry. I've got this.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.060
I'm leaving then.

Go ahead.

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.260
Why did that batch of Sri Lankan
rough gemstones from the Ji family

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.020
end up with the Song family?

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:08.980
How's your grandma?

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.700
Is her appetite better?

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.260
She's doing well.

Aunt Wenzhi,

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.460
you've been quite busy lately.

rushing to call shareholders' meetings.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.420
What else can I do?

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.340
With your father falling ill,

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.020
the company is in chaos.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.740

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.340
That's why
I've been going to the company,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.620
gathering the senior members

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.500
to talk,

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.780
trying to reassure everyone.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.020
Reassure them

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.300
or stir up trouble?

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.420
You're still as sharp-tongued
as when you were little.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.700
What do you mean by that?

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.340
I mean,

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.580
from now on,
stay out of the company affairs.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:00.940
Leave them to me.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:02.860
Aunt Wenzhi,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.260
you should take care of yourself.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.020
After all, looking after my dad
is your responsibility.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.420
Are you the family of Song Shan?

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.020
His condition has suddenly worsened.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.620
Come with me.

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:34.380
Dad!

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.420
Dad!

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.060
Doctor, what's wrong with my dad?

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.580
A sudden coronary artery blockage!

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.860
Get him to the emergency room now!

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.780
Dad!

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:52.160
[Operation Room]

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.180
Where were you just now?

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.940
I went to get some water.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.420
He was fine a moment ago.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.140
My dad's condition has worsened.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:25:59.900
Honey.

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.180
Don't dwell on it.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.220
The doctor said you need more nutrition.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.620
Drink your milk.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:12.700
Go on, drink it.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.780
Mr. Song Shan
is being transferred to the ICU.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.300
He's out of immediate danger.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.300
But he hasn't regained consciousness.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.100
When will he wake up?

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.220
I don't know. He might wake up tomorrow,

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.940
or he could remain like this forever.

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.500
It's hard to say.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.140
Song Shan's at death's door,

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.300
and he still claims not to know
about the rough gemstones.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.140
Yeah, I asked him.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.780
He said he doesn't know

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.500
how the stones ended up
in his warehouse.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.140
So he's implying

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.340
he was framed?

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.100
Who would be generous enough

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.340
to use a batch
of Sri Lankan Royal Blue sapphires

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.380
to frame him?

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:37.700
He lied?

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.100
You actually believe him?

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.940
You believe he's completely uninvolved,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:48.140
and he's just a victim

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.140
like us?

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.700
He suddenly lost consciousness.

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.380
It's suspicious.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.020
He seemed fine back then.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.100
And the hospital hadn't scheduled

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.180
intensive care for him.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.060
I really don't know why he

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.380
fell into a coma.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:15.980
Real or not,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.900
with him falling ill,

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.260
Starlight is left without a leader.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.860
Many will covet it.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.820
Find a way

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.100
to have Song Zhizhi
take over all its operations,

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:28.980
then

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:30.540
speed up the share acquisition.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.540
I want Starlight Jewelry to become ours.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.820
This is what I owe your mother.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.460
Supporting Zhizhi is possible,

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.820
but it won't be easy.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:50.780
Zhizhi,

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.980
you know, all these years,

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.860
I've never interfered
in the company matters.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:01.620
This was entirely your dad's decision.

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.340
How could Dad possibly give you

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.700
twenty percent of the shares?

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.900
Well, I've been with him
all these years.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.260
Maybe he felt I deserved it.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.060
Shan,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.180
I appreciate your concern.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.340
Are you worried
that if you pass before me,

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.020
life would be hard for me and Xiaofei?

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.740
I don't really want anything.

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.060
I just want you to get better quickly.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.820
My mom has given so much
to the Song family all these years.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.740
It's right for her to have shares.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.500
I also have two percent.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.220
Nie Xiaofei.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.220
Dad has been sick for so long.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.420
Have you visited him even once?

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.540
Have you ever considered him family?

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.620
What right do you have to speak here?

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.700
That's not fair, Zhizhi.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.420
Your dad worked tirelessly

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.460
to build Starlight Jewelry
into what it is today.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:13.500
He did it for our whole family,

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.020
for every one of us!

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.900
We all hold shares in the company.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.380
How can you say something

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.460
so nauseating with a straight face?

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.260
Dad is lying right here.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.180
Do you have a conscience?

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.980
Zhiyan is the successor
of Starlight Jewelry.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:31.260
He has already given
the succession rights to me!

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.300
Succession rights?

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.060
Your dad is still alive,

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:37.300
and you're already thinking
about inheritance?

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.060
Who exactly has no conscience
and is disgusting here?

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.580
You're really vicious.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.420
Shan, are you hearing this?

00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:48.540
This is your beloved daughter.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.900
I absolutely oppose you

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.260
taking the position
of acting general manager.

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.220
You're just a girl.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.460
You have no experience
managing a company.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.020
If we're talking about
an acting manager,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.300
I have someone to recommend.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.180
Yi Wenhan.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.060
Zhizhi,

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.660
all these years,
you've never been involved

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.300
in the company's management
or operations.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.340
You know nothing

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.460
about its affairs.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.940
What qualifies you to be

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.380
the acting general manager?

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.460
Whereas I

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.540
am fully familiar
with the company's operations.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:50.980
Although I'm currently
suspended pending review,

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.940
that doesn't mean

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.980
I'm unqualified to run
for acting general manager.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.140
And Mr. Yi Wenhan

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.420
is now Xiaofei's boyfriend.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.100
As the second-largest shareholder

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.940
of the company,
both personally and rationally,

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:09.700
I'll give him my full support in running
for acting general manager.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.580
You'd really give the position to him?

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.860
Ms. Song, choose your words carefully.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.340
Now that Xiaofei is with me,

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.740
her shares naturally support me.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.580
The General Manager position

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:29.860
will soon be mine too.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.100
There's no harm in your
calling me General Manager Yi

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:34.660
a little early, is there?
