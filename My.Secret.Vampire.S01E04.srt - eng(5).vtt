WEBVTT

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.780
But still, how could you do that?

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.980
It was frustrating.
Why?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.410
It hasn't been that many days since
I joined, and I'm going to get fired now.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.700
I'll take responsibility, so stop nagging.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.300
Take responsibility for me?

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.110
How?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.630
Hyung, what's wrong?

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.540
Are you okay?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.830
Seonjae...

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.510
What?

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.980
Call Seonjae.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.079
Lee Joowon.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.930
Seonjae, well...

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.390
Are you okay?

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.060
Where have you been?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.280
Let's go out.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.640
I'm in the middle of my work.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.350
I'll take responsibility, so stop nagging.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.950
Take responsibility for me?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.700
How?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.660
Hyung, what's wrong?

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.150
Are you okay?

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.940
What are you making?

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.260
Ginger tea.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.920
My parents always
make this for me when I'm sick.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.910
Joowon can't eat ginger or garlic.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.360
But I found
his body temperature very low just now.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.579
Doesn't he need to go to the hospital?

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.910
He's always like that. There's no need.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.350
But his temperature is low.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.160
Are you so worried about him?

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.180
Don't worry.
He's just bad at handling stress.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.360
You must be tired. Get some rest.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.220
I'll bring it to him.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.670
Hey, Lee Joowon.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.370
He can't drink it
'cause he's a half-blood.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.110
That's not true.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.440
Why don't you take a sip and show us?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.820
-Drink.
-Drink.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.430
-Drink.
-Drink!

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.290
You said you can drink it. Drink it!

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.130
You're pretty good
at pretending to be asleep.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.390
I'm really going to sleep.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.580
You really are a vampire.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.390
You can't drink blood plasma

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.250
but had a reaction like that
seeing Dongha's blood.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.630
But he's pretty kind,
still being worried about you.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.040
Speaking of, were you following
Dongha around the whole day today?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.500
You who wouldn't even leave the house
for more than 100 meters?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.930
I want to find dirt on him
and chase him out as soon as possible.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.010
Makes sense?

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.070
You said your goal
was to force him to leave quietly, no?

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.159
My head hurts. You can leave.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.610
You know we can't be together
with humans, right?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.840
What do you mean?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.600
Well... Just in case.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:05.730
You're the one being weird here, you know?

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.650
You don't usually stay home.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.800
I kept seeing you at home these days.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.820
Were you serious
when you said you liked Dongha?

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.260
You should get some rest.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.210
What is this?

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.490
Dongha said
he drinks this when he is sick.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.350
Leave it if you don't want it.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.940
I have some leftover medication.
Do you want it?

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.320
Hey, get treated.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.620
You almost killed me.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.020
I don't care if you take it or not.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.460
What are you doing?

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.870
I don't care if you die or not.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.970
What?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.460
Is this for me?

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.450
Thankfully, my injury
isn't life-threatening.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:03.980
I'll use it well.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.660
Hyung.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.240
But... How do I apply this?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.860
It hurts.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.850
You're exaggerating.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.130
You're the one who's exaggerating.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.380
What is this antique?

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.990
Can it be used?

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.630
My parents bought this for me.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.320
No wonder it's so vintage.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.350
By the way, can I ask you something?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.170
Forget it. I guess that's your privacy.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.660
I won't ask.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.720
Hey. I hate it
when people don't finish their sentences.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.450
What is it?

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.010
When did you start living here?

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.700
When I was little.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.680
With your family?

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.820
Yes. With my sister and godfather.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.360
What about your parents?

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:48.430
I don't know.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.700
Some people just don't know.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.380
My parents passed away too.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.250
When I was young, they told me

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.860
to go to a university in a big city.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.270
I kept saying no stubbornly.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.260
Yet in the end, here I am.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.720
Why didn't you want to come?

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.400
Well...

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.750
I thought I'd feel lonely.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.640
Because I'm different
from the city people.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.960
It'd feel like I'm standing alone
among other races.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.600
You probably
don't understand that feeling.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.490
But you don't have to do all this for me.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.080
If you wash it by yourself, the wound
can get inflamed after touching water.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.530
I won't let you pay for the treatment.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:14.870
Oh right.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.340
Why did you go to that bar?

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:20.280
Done.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.900
-Dongha, are you back?
-I'm here–

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.430
Is he not back yet?
He should be back.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.080
It'll be weird if we go out together.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.780
Sorry.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.950
Dongha, do you want supper?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:22.910
Spicy rice cakes?

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.980
Fried chicken?
Or all of the above?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.000
Next time maybe.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.310
Thanks to you, I've gained weight.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.190
-Hey, he finally gained weight.
-Wow.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.270
We heard it right, right?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.150
Gosh. I'm not feeling well.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.040
Is it going to rain?

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.140
Well... I thought I'd feel lonely.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:21.440
It'd feel like I'm standing alone
among other races.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.690
You know we can't be together
with humans, right?

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.050
What do you mean?

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.480
Well... Just in case.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.890
Are you... avoiding me?

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.130
No.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.380
I'm sorry about what happened earlier,
for suddenly–

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.990
It's nothing! It's okay.

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:17.130
Really.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.140
I have to get up early tomorrow.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.250
I have a favor to ask.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.280
Tonight...

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:41.800
sleep with me.
