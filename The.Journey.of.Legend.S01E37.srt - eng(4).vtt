[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.950
[Episode 37]

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.680
Chief.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.710
Liu Suifeng did exactly as you predicted.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.710
He sent Song Mingzhu to the pharmacy
for medicine.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.170
Could it be harmful to you?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.340
It won't be.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.530
Then why is Chief...

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.280
I won't agree to what he wants to do.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480
But I can't talk him out of it either.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.910
You should continue

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.470
to keep a close eye on Suifeng.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.060
I understand.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.910
Master.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.030
Please reconsider.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.960
The Tang Sect living medicine vessel said,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.560
those who became living medicine vessel

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.160
are neither human nor ghost.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.579
A fate worse than death.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.730
Mingzhu is afraid.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.760
I'm afraid that I might
never see you again.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.870
Get out.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.880
I don't want you to see

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.640
what I look like
after taking the medicine.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.870
Turns out he endures pain
beyond what normal people could bear.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.040
all for the Chief.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.160
Master is turning himself

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.070
into a living medicine vessel for Chief.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.200
He wants to trade his life for another.

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.040
Master.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.530
Mingzhu will never leave your side.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.040
I've called you all here today

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.450
because we've received news.

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.080
General Wu has started his journey
back to the capital.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.870
The Falconry Whistle Organization
has colluded with the Northern Wasteland

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.470
and bypassed Immortal Pass.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.380
They're using the waterways
to smuggle elite Northern Wastelanders

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.630
into Daxi

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.210
with sinister intentions.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.550
General Wu's return journey
is extremely dangerous.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.480
I ask you all
to ensure General Wu's safety.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.430
Take down the Falconry Whistle's base

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.890
and restore peace to Daxi.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.350
Take down the Falconry Whistle's base

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.360
and destroy the Waterways' schemes.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.870
We will do our best.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.820
That's right.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.560
The survival of the nation
is every citizenâ€™s responsibility.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.190
We shall contribute our efforts.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.120
We shall contribute our efforts.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.400
Thank you.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.080
Come.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.720
Everyone, look.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.480
Here.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.570
You'll go this way.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.340
You'll come with me this way.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.470
Good. Is that clear?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.970
Good.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.560
Brothers.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.480
This is Wu Jie.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.560
Take a good look at him.

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.390
We'll set up ambushes along the route

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.490
and catch him completely off guard.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:51.400
Good.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.200
Nobody move!

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.950
You pack of scoundrels!

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.720
How dare you plot against General Wu!

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.120
Today, we brothers
will carry out heaven's justice.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.980
Take them down!

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.240
Over ten martial world criminals
have been captured.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.480
They all claim to be hired
by the Long River waterways.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.720
Anyone who provides information

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.040
will be generously rewarded.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.270
Whoever captures Wu Jie

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.510
will be rewarded ten thousand taels.

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.850
Around Zhoushan Town in Western Capital,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.160
General Wu's whereabouts
have been discovered.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.350
Likely due to the previous attack,

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.550
he has changed his route to the capital.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.160
Near a Guan Temple in the west of town,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.960
unknown martial world figures
have been spotted.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.039
Guan Temple in the Western Capital.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.730
[Wu Jie, Renowned Border General of Daxi]

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.960
Lord Guan is a man of great honour

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.200
who protected Han with absolute loyalty.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.510
He deserves our admiration.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.510
Such a pity

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.920
that years of warfare

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:54.720
have left his temple in disrepair.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.980
After we strike at the heart of the enemy,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.750
we will surely return
to rebuild the temple.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.360
Now that traitors are ruling the court,

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.630
returning would only mean death for us.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:06.050
Death itself doesn't matter,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.870
but how can a true man
endure such humiliation?

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.840
We should return to Immortal Pass

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.720
and join our brothers

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.070
to fight all the way
to the Northern Wasteland capital

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.510
and see if they dare defy us again.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.360
Jiang Yue!

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.570
Show some respect.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:21.510
I acknowledge my fault.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.850
I can't blame you for this.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.030
The people are in the depths of misery.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.830
But the Emperor's authority is supreme

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.960
and his grace is like heaven.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.290
We must not speak rashly against him.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.150
If everyone acted this way,

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.120
there would be no order,

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.150
destroying a family's honour.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.810
How disgraceful will that be?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.720
If a nation loses its laws and principles,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.080
disaster and ruin will follow swiftly.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.270
A general in the field
may sometimes disregard orders,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.480
but our country is facing many troubles

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.390
at this critical time
of repelling invaders.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.270
If I were to act rebelliously,

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.200
I fear I would play
into the traitors' hands,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.670
harm the state

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.550
and become a sinner for the ages.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.600
Big Brother,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.660
the court is summoning you back

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.010
only to kill you!

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.970
This is their conspiracy.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.380
Even if we must return,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.810
there's no need to rush.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.600
Jiang Yue!

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.690
You guys may leave now.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.000
Yes.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.770
Yes.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.840
Lord Guan,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.840
our nation faces great peril now,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.040
with Northern Wasteland invading

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.240
and traitors within.

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:44.320
With your loyal heart and courage,

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.750
please watch over this situation

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.910
and protect us.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.910
This journey I take

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.470
will likely end in my death.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.870
The traitors want me dead to feel secure,

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.780
the court wants me dead to feel at ease,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.720
and the Northern Wastelanders
wants me dead to be content.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.370
I, Wu Xie, count my life as nothing.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.410
But our land remains divided,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.300
and the Northern Wastelanders

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.900
have invaded without cause,

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.930
plundering, killing,
and seizing our people with cruelty.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.280
Thus I swore to lead troops
against the enemy.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.270
Now I have three wishes.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.510
First, I pray for the nation's peace

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.500
and the world's tranquility.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.390
If my death

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.000
can win the people's hearts,

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:38.750
eliminate traitors,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.000
protect Daxi,

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.800
and restore our territory,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.460
I will die with a smile.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.300
My second wish

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.000
is that the court take only my life

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.910
and spare my brothers in arms

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.900
and the innocent civilians.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.800
The border defence is weak.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.830
We absolutely cannot withdraw.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.270
A withdrawal would waste all our efforts.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.080
Our brothers who shed blood and sweat

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.910
would have died in vain.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.120
May Lord Guan bless us.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:16.620
Big Brother.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.380
The Emperor's messenger has arrived.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.010
Greetings, General Wu.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.120
[Wu Jie to return immediately]

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.010
Spread the word.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.360
We leave immediately.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.080
Yes, sir.

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:46.510
For my third wish,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.370
I'm willing to go through
hell and high water.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.480
Otherwise,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.240
when our country is no longer a country,

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.790
how can we have homes?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.510
When the nest falls,

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:58.890
no eggs remain intact.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.620
I hope our frontline soldiers
can defend Immortal Pass to the death.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.090
Hero,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.910
you truly care about me.

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.640
I appreciate it deeply.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.000
I'm not acting on impulse

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.510
or seeking fame for posterity.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.430
I'm simply willing to die

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.670
to preserve my complete loyalty.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.600
[General Wu in peril at the Guan Temple
of Zhoushan, Western Capital]

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:37.640
Brother.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.880
Yuan'er.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:49.190
Brother.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.200
The Soul-Piercing Nail was just removed.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.130
You should be resting properly now

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.180
and follow instructions.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.000
Yuan'er.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.410
You've really grown up,

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:00.640
not like before.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.460
You used to follow me around
calling "brother" all the time.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.100
Look,

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.510
now you're the one taking care of me.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.240
Who told you to be so troublesome?

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.320
Oh right,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:15.390
look at this.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.790
This is...

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240
This is for you.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.000
For me?

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:27.840
It's beautiful.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.880
Do you like it?

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.010
Of course I like it, it's from you.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.120
Is it pretty?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.720
It's gorgeous.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.270
This medicine is too bitter.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.440
How nice it would be
to have some fresh fish right now.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.240
I'll go make some fish for you right away.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:57.960
Wait for me.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.170
Brother.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.680
Who would have thought,

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.030
all the notorious villains

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.790
in the Daxi martial world have gathered.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.510
Zhu the Great King, of the waterways,

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.160
has sent Wanli, Qianli, and Baili,

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.620
three great masters here.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.790
Today,

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:40.680
we will capture General Wu
in one fell swoop.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.920
How dare you!

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.110
Such treacherous traitors,

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.690
shameless and despicable!

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.680
Let me clear the obstacles for General Wu!

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.640
In the Western Capital,
there's revelry every night,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.400
while at the border,
soldiers die wrapped in horsehide.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.750
Poor Lord Guan,

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.610
no one even worships him anymore.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:46.720
General,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:49.580
it looks like there was just a fight here.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.620
Mr. Yan.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.030
As they say, a true man
would rather die on the battlefield

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.440
than perish at the hands of sycophants.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.580
Those people I killed outside

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.230
aren't just scums of the martial world.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.110
Northern Wastelanders have infiltrated
among them.

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.110
There's a bounty from the waterways

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.110
to ambush and kill you.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.070
General Wu,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.640
please reconsider.

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.920
If you're in danger,

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.880
it would be the same as

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.830
the death of countless civilians.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.200
Mr. Yan speaks words of wisdom.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.000
However...

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.790
However what?

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.200
Although I know this journey is dangerous,

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:53.160
I must still proceed.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.400
Only by meeting the Emperor in person,

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.750
can I possibly protect our nation.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.790
Daxi faces many hardships,

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.720
snd now is the time to repel our enemies.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.270
If I were to back down,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.270
I fear it would play right into

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.330
the schemes of
those treacherous court officials.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.920
If something happens to you,

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.350
who else in the world

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.310
could lead troops
against the Northern Wastelanders

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.510
and protect our land?

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:17.510
Mr. Yan, your good intentions

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.830
are appreciated.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:22.510
General Wu.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.880
What if I use this Hero Command Token

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.960
to stop you

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.030
from returning to court?

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.620
The fate of Daxi

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.000
is in your hands.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.470
I have no choice.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.480
I'll let you die knowing the truth.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.510
It's you.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.570
Where is General Wu?

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.480
General Wu has been captured
by my waterway agents,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.240
Wanli, Qianli, and Baili.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.560
Today at this Guan Di Temple,

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.640
you are the one we've been waiting for.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.040
The number one madman
of the martial world,

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:36.920
Crazy Yan.

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:41.310
Your internal energy,

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.470
I shall take it all.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.100
Brother!

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:00.820
Brother!

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.680
Xiao Kaiyan, you're insane!

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.760
I won't let you hurt my brother!

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.920
Now that you have your real brother,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.400
have you forgotten about me,
your second brother?

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.030
You're the one who harmed our parents

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.620
and destroyed the Xiao family.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.440
You don't deserve to be my brother.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.920
Then watch carefully.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.960
See who is truly superior

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.210
and who is the true heir
of the Xiao family.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:25.000
No!

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.300
You don't want him to die?

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.830
Fine.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.590
As long as you obediently follow my orders

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.790
and do as I say.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:45.750
I promise you.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.310
As long as you don't harm my brother,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.760
I'm willing to exchange my life for his.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.960
I won't let you die.

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.030
Crazy Yan,

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.060
didn't you want to see General Wu?

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.350
Take him away.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.900
Alliance Leader Xiao.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.760
We were ambushed
on our way back to the capital.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.240
The General,
seeing the situation was suspicious,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.440
ordered us to split up

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.640
and take the imperial tiger tally with us

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.440
to pass it to you, Alliance Leader Xiao.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.700
I ask that Alliance Leader Xiao
safeguard this tiger tally

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.120
and rescue the General.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.550
Qiu.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.300
Take Deputy Commander Jiang to rest.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.240
Yes.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:39.350
Thank you.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.610
Deputy Commander Jiang, please.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.030
I've carefully selected these for you.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.280
Do you like them?

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.640
Don't frown.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:18.720
You're not beautiful when you frown.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.100
Look at my water fortress.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.460
It's a hundred times more magnificent
than Huanhua's.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.310
If you come with me,

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.920
whatever Yiren and Qiushui can give you,

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.450
I'll give you twice as much.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.310
Wealth and luxury,

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.510
power and prestige,

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.130
you'll have it all.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.290
I want to see my brother.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.960
As long as you behave,

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.010
your brother won't die.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:59.200
I'll even let you see each other often.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.530
How about wearing this one?

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.970
It suits you quite well.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.810
It looks beautiful.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.520
Mr. Yan, you're very clever.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.730
You didn't struggle too much.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.010
You should know that I've already blocked

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.140
all your pressure points.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.370
The Three Crown Kings of the Outer Realm.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:10.070
You are Baili, Frozen Pavilions,

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:12.090
[The Three Crown Kings of the Outer Realm;
Baili, Frozen Pavilions]

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.680
[The Three Crown Kings of the Outer Realm;
Qianli, Lone Plum Blossoms]

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.280
Qianli, Lone Plum Blossoms,

00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:17.660
and Wanli, Endless Plains.

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.610
[The Three Crown Kings of the Outer Realm;
Wanli, Endless Plains.]

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.680
As expected of Crazy Yan.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.270
We've been in seclusion for years,

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.800
yet you still recognise us.

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.030
I just never thought

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.750
we would meet here.

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:32.880
If I hadn't promised General Helian

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.440
to prioritize the greater mission,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.070
I would really like to test my skills
against the best in the Central Plains.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:40.200
You're just talking to yourselves.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.650
You think I can't break through
these pressure points?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.480
Mr. Yan's martial arts are unparalleled.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.160
Of course you can.

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.070
However,

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.610
I won't give you that much time.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:11.090
Mr. Yan's martial prowess

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.240
will soon be mine to use.

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.510
The "Voidheart Codex"
from the Central Plains

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.040
actually contains such strange techniques.

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:01.470
What's happening?

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.960
Why can't I absorb

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:05.550
all your power?

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:07.550
The Voidheart Codex

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.200
must have been obtained

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.270
through despicable means, right?

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.720
So you only know how to absorb,

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.550
but not how to transform the energy.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.030
Want to absorb my power?

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.510
Be careful not to burst yourself.

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.680
That's not for you to worry.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.680
Sooner or later,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.550
I will take

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.690
every single bit of your power.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.750
Seniors,

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:32.920
please take good care of Mr. Yan.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960
I heard that Chief

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.200
will be entering the palace tomorrow.

00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:03.070
Today, Suifeng

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.580
has come specially to see you off.

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.610
I wish you a smooth journey.

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.200
May the great cause planned for Daxi

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.130
surely succeed.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.680
Suifeng,

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:28.800
that's thoughtful of you.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.000
The second cup.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.610
I wish the Chief good health

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.670
and longevity.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.910
In life or death, I, Suifeng,

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.630
am willing to follow you, Chief.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.250
Before drinking this cup,

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:18.200
I also have a toast

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.070
for you.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.350
I hope when this is over,

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.240
you can have your own life,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.810
not bound by the Power Gang,

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.370
not bound to me,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.330
nor trapped by grudges.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.830
I will try my best.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.550
Why?

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:54.340
Itâ€™s in this wine

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.200
that your true dream lies.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.240
Have a good sleep.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.350
Chief.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.520
You can't enter the palace.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.270
How is he?

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.680
He won't eat or drink,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.160
and doesn't say a word.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.310
Your mind is in chaos.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.350
It's only a matter of time
before you lose control of your powers.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.110
Shut up!

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.620
At a time like this,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.720
you still dare to be so insolent?

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.550
Go!

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.290
Bring Xiao Xueyu here.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.470
Yes.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:12.870
Brother.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:17.270
Xueyu.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.230
Don't you have a lot to say to him?

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.720
Try to persuade him.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:27.630
-Brother.
-I'm fine.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.550
In a few days,

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.070
I'll find a way to get you out.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:36.920
No need.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.750
I don't want you to take risks for me.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.250
Brother.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.980
Listen to me.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.270
What I'm about to say is crucial.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:46.870
Come here.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.860
The Voidheart Codex.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.830
The 15 tiers of the Voidheart Codex are

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:04.350
Heaven's Will, Earth's Shape, King's Rule,
Family's Love, Master's Teaching,

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:10.150
Metal's Break, Wood's Resist, Water's
Flow, Fire's Spread, Earth's Cover,

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:16.320
Sun's Glow, Moon's Reflection, Wind's
Path, Cloud's Shade, and Self's Void.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.650
The carriage has arrived.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.770
Shirong,

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.470
it's time to go back.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.650
For your first time in the capital,

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:44.870
you stayed in the palace for three days.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.850
The second time, you stayed for ten days.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.620
After that, your stays
have became longer and longer.

00:37:57.030 --> 00:37:58.070
This time,

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.110
I don't know when you'll return.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.230
Things

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.320
always get harder as they progress.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:14.670
Fortunately,

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.030
it's almost over.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.320
Don't worry.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.410
As long as I've done my best,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.030
I have no regrets.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.700
â™ª Stars and moon brush my face â™ª

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.330
â™ª The journey of life
spreads out like a long scroll â™ª

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:48.110
â™ª Past events linger
in the corner of my eye â™ª

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:52.850
â™ª First meetings, then farewells â™ª

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.100
â™ª How many layers in heaven and earth â™ª

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:00.850
â™ª The mortal world is always the same â™ª

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:04.610
â™ª Clouds and mountains
stretch west and east â™ª

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.330
â™ª Chivalry dwells in the heart â™ª

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.380
â™ª In the mortal world,
nothing lasts forever â™ª

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.410
â™ª A few words, laughter shared â™ª

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.360
â™ª Swords and books,
the thrill of the blade â™ª

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.170
â™ª Parting under thousands of miles
of wind, rain, and snow â™ª

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.550
â™ª Embarking on the long road,
freely at ease â™ª

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.450
â™ª Life in the world doesn't stop
with mere passing â™ª

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.480
â™ª Several tides rise and fall â™ª

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:32.750
â™ª Singing of the present while drunk â™ª

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.300
â™ª Raising my head
to finish this cup of wine â™ª

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:39.430
â™ª All grudges in the martial world
vanish in a stroke â™ª

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.780
Chief!

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:05.690
Chief!

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:12.760
Master!

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:14.660
Master, you're awake.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:16.420
Has the Chief

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.790
already entered the palace?

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.140
Yes.

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:24.400
No!

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:26.130
I must get him back.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.360
Master!

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.950
Even if we chase after him now,

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.210
it's already too late.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.230
The Chief has maneuvered through life.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.920
His actions must've been
carefully considered.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:44.670
I hope...

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:47.110
I hope the Chief

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.010
can use his internal energy
to suppress the poison.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.550
As long as it doesn't damage
his heart meridian,

00:41:54.550 --> 00:41:56.680
there might still be a glimmer of hope.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.230
Master, please don't panic.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.420
There must be a way.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.110
Drink this herbal medicine
to calm your nerves.
