[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.930
[Episode 36]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.920
This cloak...

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.810
This cloak belonged to my sister Yuan.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.040
Senior.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.710
There were too many people around earlier,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.240
so I didn't have a chance
to return it to you.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.150
Old Madam Wu

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.400
and Sect Leader Zhichen

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.660
entrusted me to give it to you.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.750
Sect Leader Zhichen once mentioned

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.640
that back then, your sister

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.770
was kidnapped by the Jiang brothers.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.680
During her escape,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.680
she unfortunately contracted
a serious illness.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.310
Fortunately, Sect Leader Zhichen

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.520
happened to pass by
and was able to save her.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.380
But after that,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.840
there was no more news of her.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.750
It was all my fault.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.000
This is the greatest regret

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.000
of my entire life.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.380
[Tang Yaoshun]

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.760
The Tang Sect is already under my control.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.870
Xiao Qiushui,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.120
how will you respond to this?

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.870
Sancai has sent word that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.000
General Wu will immediately

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.030
return to the capital
after receiving the imperial order.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.760
Big Brother.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.710
If General Wu leaves the Immortal Pass,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.520
what if the Northern Wasteland
seizes the chance to attack?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.250
Wouldn't that be a big problem?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.870
Not only that,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.980
General Wu might also face danger

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.970
on his way back to the capital.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.720
So we need to act quickly.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.040
Any delay

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.440
will put General Wu in greater danger.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.760
We've all been investigating separately,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.870
and we've found some

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.670
suspicious locations related to
the falconry whistle activities.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.470
Assemble people
to investigate immediately.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.040
Okay.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.920
Search carefully!

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.600
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.870
Yuhan.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.510
Guys.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.870
The outpost over there

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.590
has been cleared by the Power Gang.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.510
-How about here?
-That's great.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.870
This must be the Falconry Whistle hideout.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.720
At least the Power Gang
knows better this time.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.360
Hope they cooperate with us properly
this time

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.560
to catch those spies.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.850
Since Big Brother trusts them,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.580
let's do it.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.600
Let's go!

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.570
Let's go.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.430
It's cooled down.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.200
Chief, is your old injury

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.270
flaring up again?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.070
It's not that.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.480
He's simply unaware of his age

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.580
and has been wearing himself out

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.710
with constant work.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.440
Now that you're down,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.070
all the sect affairs, big and small,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.870
have all fallen on my shoulders.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.600
How's the situation over there?

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.430
Xiao Kaiyan has been using
the Twelve Serial Docks

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.120
as his base.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.630
The waterways are interconnected,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.510
and the hidden water networks
are extremely complex.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.480
We haven't found anything conclusive yet.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.240
Then send more people there.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.430
Yes.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.270
This is the information
that Song Mingzhu and others

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.720
intercepted from Falconry Whistle.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.480
"20,000 elite soldiers will take
the water route,

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.920
bypass the Immortal Pass to head south,

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.780
and infiltrate Daxi to launch
a coordinated strike

00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.360
from inside and out."

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.120
If the Northern Wastelanders
really succeed in crossing south,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.720
it would utterly crush

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.680
the people's confidence
in resisting the Northern Wasteland.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.830
The Northern Wasteland is feigning peace,

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.160
while secretly amassing
200,000 soldiers ready to strike.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.680
The court has summoned General Wu back,

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.720
and morale at Immortal Pass is crumbling.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.780
The martial world is also in turmoil,

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.120
and worse, some treacherous people,
bribed by the waterways,

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.160
have gone so far as to commit treason
by colluding with the enemy.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.240
We must ensure General Wu's safety

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.160
to stabilize the war situation.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.510
If he returns to the capital,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.270
I fear the Immortal Pass will fall.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.470
If he doesn't return,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.930
he'll be charged with fabricated crimes.

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.360
If you report to His Majesty

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.000
about the waterways' collusion
with the Northern Wasteland,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.830
could it soften the court's stance?

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.210
Suifeng,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.870
gather more men

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.310
to eliminate Falconry Whistle's base

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.310
and block the Northern Wasteland's
elite troops from advancing south.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.270
Yes.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.960
I wish I could share more of your burden.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.270
I heard the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.240
is also trying to eliminate
Falconry Whistle's base.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.120
Daxi

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.630
has finally come to such a state.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.720
Master.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.380
I have a feeling that
something's off with Chief's health.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.640
Keep an eye on him.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.720
Mr. Yan.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.870
You should move around less.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:38.440
Here.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:40.370
Take your medicine first.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.650
Physician Xiao.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.320
My injury has already healed.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.790
You need to take time to rest and recover.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.510
As for the Soul-Piercing Nail,

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:50.710
Qiushui and I will have someone
to find another solution.

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.090
This little injury is nothing.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.290
Don't make such a fuss.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.020
[Huaiyang]

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.750
Chief Li.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.380
What's this supposed to mean?

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.720
This Chief's Token

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.680
is the Power Gang's symbol of authority

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.870
and something revered
throughout the martial world.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.250
The reason all sects fear it

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.030
is because the Power Gang

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.630
holds dirt on every sect, isn't it?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.080
Mr. Xiao, you certainly know how to joke.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.870
Mr. Xiao, it seems

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.440
you deeply despise our Power Gang.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.510
Relationships built on profit end
when profit does.

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.440
Relationships built on influence collapse
when influence fades.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.320
Relationships built on power are abandoned
when power is lost.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.320
Chief Li.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.910
Don't you have to use the Misery Pill

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.430
and the Tribulation Finger
to force people into submission?

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:35.790
Indeed.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.250
But in these chaotic times,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.910
only by wielding powerful measures

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.310
and clearing all hurdles

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:44.320
can the situation be firmly stabilized

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.270
for those who follow.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.910
By exchanging hearts with sincerity
and keeping ambitions modest,

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.570
true friendship will endure.

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.630
This is the only way we can rebuild
a new martial world.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.600
But your doings
resemble more the tactics of an emperor,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.400
not the way of the martial world.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.500
If that's the case,

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.840
then Mr. Xiao,

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.400
why don't you just be

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.640
the successor
who rebuilds the way of the martial world?

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.030
As long as one has a chivalrous heart,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.760
anyone can become a successor.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.960
Chief Li, you should take

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.880
your Chief's Token back.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.030
Though we share the same destination,

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.960
we can no longer walk the same path.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.720
I'm going to the capital for an audience
with His Majesty,

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.650
and I must take my wine on schedule.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.720
Could it be

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.440
the wine's poisoned?

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.630
The poison has penetrated to
my bones and marrow.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.550
Now

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.920
I'm truly gravely ill
and unlikely to recover.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.510
Since you know the wine's poisoned,

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.080
why do you keep drinking it?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.440
I have no other choice.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:10.670
I fear not death,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:13.210
but I really don't know

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:15.250
who else I can give this token to.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.510
Chief Li,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.200
you still don't understand.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.510
The martial world is like
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.170
Even if I run around shouting,

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.080
I can only awaken like-minded people.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.630
This is not a path of my own making,

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.760
but the one that meets the hopes of all.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.390
So be it.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.840
The court intends to stop the war,

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.670
so they've summoned General Wu
back to the capital.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.870
But now, the Northern Wasteland
has colluded with the waterways

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.000
to infiltrate elite troops into Daxi.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.200
I believe this battle is inevitable.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.840
Therefore, we must not let General Wu

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.880
leave the Immortal Pass.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.510
Then we must unite

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.720
and do everything to rescue General Wu.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.670
The martial world
needs no leader hereafter.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.200
Driven by righteousness or by profit,

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.930
everyone has their own choice.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.960
I must not tell Master

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.580
about Chief being poisoned.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.320
Master.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.280
Just tell me what you heard.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.070
Chief is going to hand over
the Power Gang to Xiao Qiushui.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.630
What else did Chief mention?

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.070
Chief also said

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.730
that the Power Gang's ways are outdated,

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.320
and he asked Xiao Qiushui
to lead everyone to transform

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.720
and integrate into some new martial world.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:26.870
I really don't understand.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:28.630
Master, you've been completely loyal
to the Power Gang

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.870
and served for so many years.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.800
Master, how could Chief bypass you

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.910
and pass leadership to an outsider?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.570
Chief wouldn't hand over his position
for no reason.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.910
His actions today

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.720
are very unusual.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.720
Could it be

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.330
that his condition is as I've feared,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.520
beyond medical help?

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.440
M-Master.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:00.910
You already knew?

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.770
I want you to go somewhere with me.

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:15.130
I haven't shown my face for years.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.240
A bunch of nobodies
seeking the Voidheart Codex

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.840
have all come looking for me.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:20.930
Unfortunately,

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.780
none of them can take a hit.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.480
Over the years in the martial world,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.630
each generation is worse than the last.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.960
It's becoming less and less interesting.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.320
You two,

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:41.950
what exactly do you want?

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:42.880
If you're smart,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.610
have Crazy Yan hand over
the Voidheart Codex!

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.320
Cowards.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.270
If you've got the guts,
go see Mr. Yan yourselves.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.910
Going to him is no different from
seeking death.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.030
We're not that stupid.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.630
Attack!

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.390
Hurry!

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.600
The dart is poisoned. She won't get far.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.930
Everyone, split up and search!

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:03.560
Let's go!

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.960
Physician Xiao.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:36.000
Physician Xiao!

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.030
It's Mr. Yan.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:01.900
Physician Xiao!

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.310
Why is this whistle sound...

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:34.720
Mr. Yan!

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:37.440
Physician Xiao.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.680
How did this whistle end up with you?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.400
Yuan...

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.880
You are Yuan?

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.880
You really are Yuan.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.470
I finally found you.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.170
I'm your older brother.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.270
Brother?

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:12.950
You don't remember?

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.270
I understand why you don't remember me.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:17.160
But look.

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:19.150
Look at this Golden Swallow.

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.910
Does it remind you of anything?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.260
This is the only keepsake Mother left us.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.580
Only the sound of your whistle

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.680
can awaken it.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.070
No wonder.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:07.200
All these days,

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.310
I've been dreaming of

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.440
my brother and me

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.970

That day, Old Madam Wu

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.830
entrusted the Golden Swallow to me.

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.300
I never expected

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.750
that the person you were looking for

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.970
would turn out to be my sister.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:55.670
I remember when I was a child,

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.670
I was kidnapped by villains.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.240
Due to the trauma

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.400
and the injury to the back of my head,

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.800
my childhood memories became very blurry.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.540
Thanks to the Golden Swallow,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.450
we siblings
have finally recognized each other.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.970
I'm truly happy

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
that I got to see you again, Brother.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.510
But I came to the Xiao family
at a very young age,

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.850
and they've always treated me
like their own daughter.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:21.850
You can be at ease.

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.680
I...

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:27.390
I've put you through so much.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.360
I don't even know
how to make it up to you.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.360
Brother,

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.720
I ask for nothing else;

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:36.510
I only hope you can agree to one thing
for me.

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:37.110
Of course.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.040
Go ahead.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.640
The Soul-Piercing Nail in your body

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.640
must be removed as soon as possible.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.270
Senior.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.040
All right.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.270
Good.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.750
Since you've agreed so readily, Senior,

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:04.480
you can't change your mind now.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.610
Alright, Xueyu.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.000
Take good care of Senior.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.200
I'll go out for a while.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.310
Wait for me to come back.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.920
Qiushui,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.970
thank you for your help.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.400
[Tang Sect]

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.790
During the Tang Sect incident,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.500
Tang Yaoshun and Old Madam Tang
were killed by Tang Song,

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.360
and Tang Fang was also controlled
by puppet needle.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.880
This is weird.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.200
The gate is wide open,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.120
and there's not even a single guard
on duty.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680
Stop right there.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.310
Take another half step forward,

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.970
and your guts will be torn out.

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:50.800
Thank you for the warning, Master.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.640
The Tang Sect doesn't open its gate
to welcome guests,

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.200
but to face enemies.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.440
So are we going in or not?

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.060
This isn't the only entrance.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.960
Who are these people?

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.650
Why are they all locked up here?

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.040
They're living medicine vessels.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.200
My blood is almost drained dry.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.330
Please stop taking it.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.130
Please stop.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.680
Please.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.760
Please stop.

00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.240
Please.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.400
Someone's finally here.

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:56.310
Has Mr. Tang finally remembered me?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.880
I knew it.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.920
I knew he would need me,
the living medicine vessel

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.240
he created with his own hands,
sooner or later.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:03.960
Mr. Tang

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680
is dead.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.680
What?

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.310
How did he die?

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:09.920
I killed him.

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.310
Dead?

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.350
He's actually dead?

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.000
Becoming a living medicine vessel

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.800
means suffering for a lifetime.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.600
I've held on until now

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.240
just to wait for Mr. Tang,

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.400
so I could kill him
with my own hands and get my revenge.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.530
And now, you tell me he's already dead,

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:33.960
and that you killed him!

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:36.870
How could you beat me to killing him?

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.790
You old man.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.240
We hadn't even touched you,
yet you went and attacked us.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.440
Young man,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.920
that medicinal scent on you... You must be

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.640
one of the living medicine vessels
Mr. Tang cultivated later, aren't you?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.240
But you're quite fortunate.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:08.310
You haven't become
a true living medicine vessel yet.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.550
Since you killed him,

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:12.000
why have you come here?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.680
I want Mr. Tang's
Secret Method of Meridian Restoration.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.110
Once you become a living medicine vessel,

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:20.480
you'll be controlled by others for life.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.680
Do you know that
the Secret Method of Meridian Restoration

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.140
requires a life for a life?

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.750
A life for a life?

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.720
Of course I know.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.510
All those who treat lives as worthless

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.600
deserve to die!

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.240
Master.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.320
I found it.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.210
Let's go.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.310
-Let's go find Tang Fang.
-Being neither human nor ghost

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.500
is the suffering of
being living medicine vessel!

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.060
It's something
you should fully experience!

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:24.810
Where is Tang Fang?

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.110
If you hurt me now,

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.710
she won't let you off easily.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:43.310
Fang.

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.040
Tang Fang.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.510
Hurry up and do it.

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.000
He's the one

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.840
who killed your father.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.370
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.780
Get the ring first!

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.710
Fang!

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.370
Brother.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:41.540
Let's go.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.110
Tang Fang!

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.170
Master and I are here to save you.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.960
Let's go.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.290
Chief, this...

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:17.200
Feel free to tell me.

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.270
It's only been a few days,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.860
but the poison is spreading

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.200
much faster than I expected.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:26.640
Chief,

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.460
if you want to detox,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.920
as I mentioned before,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.640
only the Tang Sect's...

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:45.640
Chief.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:47.640
The Strengthening Pill

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.540
has miraculous effects
in strengthening the body.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.750
It may help alleviate
the poison within you.

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.680
Herbal King is unable to
detoxify you, Chief,

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.310
but I am.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.930
Herbal King.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.240
Please go to Mr. Xiao's place

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.010
and check on Miss Tang.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.550
Yes.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.310
I'll use the Tang Sect's
living medicine vessel

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:28.640
to detoxify you, Chief.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.350
Suifeng.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.680
You just heard it too.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.720
Herbal King gave me a Strengthening Pill.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.270
Now that you've joined the Power Gang,

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:40.880
you're granted a new life.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.270
From now on,

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.640
you don't have to be trapped
in these old grudges anymore.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.500
What you did for me before, Chief,

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.510
I will never forget.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.920
Don't overthink it.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.280
You may go now.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.030
Mr. Xiao,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.500
the puppet needle in Miss Tang's body

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:16.890
has penetrated into her bone marrow.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.750
If...

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.920
If what?

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:21.070
Please speak frankly, Senior.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.720
If there's any carelessness,

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.590
the puppet needle
will lash back at its remover.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:27.270
Mr. Xiao,

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.680
perhaps we should wait a bit longer.

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.140
Senior,

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.720
this is a matter of life and death.

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.240
Since it has penetrated into
her bone marrow,

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.680
we cannot wait any longer.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.200
I beg you to tell me
how to save her, Senior.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.920
Mr. Xiao,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.010
when removing the needles,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.070
you must protect yourself

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.070
to prevent the puppet needle
from entering your meridians.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.680
Be extremely careful of the backlash.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.870
Otherwise...

00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.600

You just had
the Soul-Piercing Nail removed,

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:07.410
so please drink less.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:12.510
Have some too.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.070
I never thought

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.920
that I, Crazy Yan,
the top fighter in the world,

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.240
would actually be terrified of
a single glare from Yuan.

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.040
Now that she's not here,

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.410
I finally dare to have a drink with you.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.670
You're not terrified.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.000
You just care about her.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.180
I really didn't expect

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.880
that you actually went to the Power Gang

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.810
and brought Herbal King here for me

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.860
to remove the Soul-Piercing Nail

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.960
from my body.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.680
But the Soul-Piercing Nail

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.770
had affected me deeply.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.460
I fear I may never recover.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.280
Don't tell Yuan about this for now.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.720
Let me ask you.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.920
What is the purpose of living?

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.300
To savor life while alive,

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.880
to die without regrets,

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.450
and to do what righteousness demands.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.560
Then this life has not been in vain!

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.660
This life has not been in vain!

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.290
Make sure you get all the herbs

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:34.510
listed on this prescription for me.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:35.710
No mistakes allowed.

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.880
Why do you need these herbs, Master?

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:42.890
Just do as you're told.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:45.360
Don't ask about anything else.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:46.880
I shouldn't have asked.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:50.360
-It's just I want to help...
-Are you doubting me?

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.810
I wouldn't dare.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.410
Whatever your decision is,

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.440
I'll help you accomplish it.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.910
I only wish to stay by your side, Master,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.710
until my last breath.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:08.770
Be careful.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.200
Let no outsider learn of it.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.760
Okay.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.000
I'll gather all the herbs for you
right away, Master.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.630
Buns! Buns!

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.110
Come get your buns!

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.320
Freshly steamed buns!

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.150
Buns! Buns!

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.320
Come buy some buns!

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.250
Careful, it's hot.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.160
Deliver this medicine back to Master.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280
Use the back door.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:41.270
Yes.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.680
Boss, I'll leave the money here.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.230
Red Phoenix, why would you have time
to visit a pharmacy?

00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:59.030
Of course

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.320
I'm here to buy medicine.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:02.710
Is there a problem?

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.150
The medicine you came specially to buy

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.550
must be quite important.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.070
I'm curious to see it.

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.670
Master caught a slight cold today,

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.370
so I came specifically
to get some medicine for him.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.370
If you don't believe me, Blade King,

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.860
feel free to check.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.850
Liu Suifeng had you come all the way
just to collect these herbs?

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.320
Whatever concerns Master,

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.590
I handle personally.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.280
It's none of your business.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.740
Our sect is in turmoil now.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.320
Who knows who the next traitor will be?

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.440
I certainly hope

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:34.270
this blade I made for Liu Suifeng

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.970
will never need to be used.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.030
If it were,

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.810
it would break Chief's heart.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.690
Rest assured, Blade King.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:44.320
This precious blade you forged

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.450
will never be needed in this lifetime.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.320
Sorry that your trouble
has been for nothing.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.320
He's the most cunning and calculating one
in our sect.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.370
How can you guarantee his loyalty?

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.840
I don't have to think about that.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.240
I only seek to follow him.

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:01.750
If he's disloyal,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.110
then use that blade in your hand

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:05.320
to kill me first.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.280
Defending such a cold-faced demon

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.510
like this,

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.400
it's truly surprising.

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.000
That's because none of you
understand Master.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.530
He only appears heartless,

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.460
but the deep affection
he has for those he values

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.960
is beyond anything you could imagine.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:26.390
Since you're willing to
speak so highly of him,

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.250
you must be someone he values too.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:32.450
Those Master truly values

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:37.250
are very few indeed.
