[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.910
[Episode 35]

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.680
Then raise your heads and see clearly

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.720
who your true Heavenly King really is.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.190
But...

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.140
[Endless Plains, Northern Wasteland]

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.480
[Cai Qishen, Flame Lord]

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.340
I pledge to follow you, Heavenly King,
to the death.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.000
The Twelve Serial Docks

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.590
were originally as close as a family.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.320
Heavenly King,
you've looked after our families

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.390
and allowed us to enjoy the pinnacle
of the martial world,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.750
gaining both fame and wealth.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.280
This is truly our blessing.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.430
We pledge to follow the Heavenly King
to the death!

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.230
We pledge to follow the Heavenly King
to the death!

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.079
If this plan succeeds,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.870
your future identity

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.020
could be Constable Tieyi,

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.800
Xiao Kaiyan,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.470
or perhaps

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.360
even the Imperial Advisor.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.070
Wu Jie is determined to
fight against the Northern Wasteland.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.100
The pro-war faction in the court

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.760
all look to him as their model.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.420
I've summoned him back to the capital
many times to defend the state.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.360
What I seek is peace
and an end to the war.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.160
This is all for the sake of
Daxi's state and people.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.660
I believe

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.730
the people will surely understand
my good intentions.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.720
It's a great blessing
for the people of Daxi

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.320
to have a sovereign
as benevolent as Your Majesty.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.960
Your Majesty need only continue
sending edicts to the Immortal Pass,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.380
commanding Wu Jie to return to
the capital without delay.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.670
I've already stationed a sizable force

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.480
in ambush along his route back.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.329
We'll surely capture him.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.329
You mean

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.530
if Wu Jie falls into your hands,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.680
the soldiers at the Immortal Pass
will surely

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.560
fear the Northern Wasteland Army
breaking through

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.540
and won't dare speak out.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
Then Wu Jie will appear to be
ignoring imperial orders

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.440
and openly defying the throne.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.680
Am I right?

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.540
The determination of our soldiers and
the people to resist

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.520
the Northern Wasteland
is Your Majesty's greatest obstacle now.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.470
Using this matter

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.410
to discourage the soldiers
and court officials

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.540
from their resolve to resist the north

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.520
will not only appease
the Northern Wasteland,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.960
but can also ultimately
pave the way for peace.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.420
It'll be killing three birds
with one stone.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.360
Good.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.590
Brilliant.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.339
Excellent.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.440
What a brilliant
three-birds-with-one-stone plan.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.270
At this moment,
I truly wish to honor you as

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.420
the Imperial Advisor.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.850
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.920
Alright.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.409
Wu Jie has served with merit.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.210
If one day he truly falls into your hands,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.190
there's no need for punishment.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.560
Just let him return to his hometown
with honor.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.560
Yes.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.430
So what do you think, Senior?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120
As long as you help our Northern Wasteland

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.650
seize the fertile lands
of the Central Plains

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.159
and fulfill your promise

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.640
to give the three of us
the Voidheart Codex once this is done,

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.280
we couldn't care less about
who the Heavenly King is.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.630
Everything's falling into place.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.560
You've all earned your share of
the credit,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.360
so of course,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.630
the perks won't be missing.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.310
Qiushui,

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.460
I'll make you kneel before me

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.350
and admit you were wrong.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.430
When all's said and done,
victory will be mine.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:38.610
Show yourself.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.180
Big Brother,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.310
are you awake?

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.920
Many martial sects have arrived outside,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.180
all waiting to discuss matters with you,
Alliance Leader.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.310
He should be awake by now.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.000
Didn't Xueyu say

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.580
Big Brother's injuries
were no longer serious?

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:58.409
Yes, she did.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.920
Big Brother?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.310
Crazy Yan.

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.450
What's this about?

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.240
Need to pee?

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.430
Hold on. We'll be there soon.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.320
Where exactly are you taking me?

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.780
Let me go first.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.560
If you have something to say,

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.760
we can talk properly.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.060
I've already subdued you.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.159
Do you think I still need to
talk properly with you?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.950
When the 16 major sects
besieged me back then,

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.350
they didn't talk properly with me, either.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.000
Besides, you're as stubborn as a mule.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.240
Good thing I'm in a hurry.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.920
Isn't this more efficient?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.690
Senior, you've been in seclusion for years
since the Wuxing Mountain battle.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.560
Your return to the martial world this time

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.330
must be for some unfinished business.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.790
As long as you're not up to
anything immoral,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.320
I agree to go with you.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.630
As expected, I wasn't wrong about you.

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.230
Worthy of being my disciple.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.690
You do have courage.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.470
It's not in vain
that I brought you here specially.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:35.909
So, Senior,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.130
where are we going?

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.190
Wudang,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.340
just ahead.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.430
I wonder

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.310
why you want to go to Wudang, Senior.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.480
To persuade Wudang and Shaolin
to merge their martial skills.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.160
The Northern Wasteland
is now eyeing us covetously.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.490
Each sect in the Daxi martial world
harbors its own schemes,

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.070
and on top of that, some villains
even colluded with the Northern Wasteland,

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.070
resulting in heavy casualties
among the major sects.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.600
If we want to restore glory

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.680
to the martial world within 10 years,

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.880
there's only one way:

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.800
persuade Wudang and Shaolin

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.000
to set aside their differences

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.270
and combine the martial skills
of the two sects together.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.880
Only then can mastery be achieved.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.430
Then, those skills
should be spread widely,

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.760
so all righteous warriors can learn them.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:36.950
There will be no more barriers
among sects.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.200
With unity in the martial world,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.659
we can surely stand against
the Northern Wasteland together.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.880
Your intentions are truly noble, Senior.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.550
This concerns the fate
of the entire martial world.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.410
It's just that Shaolin and Wudang

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.150
won't be easily persuaded.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.790
At this moment, Shaolin's new abbot
is visiting Wudang.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.900
We must not miss this opportunity.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.970
At the Heroes' Gathering,

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:20.350
you exposed Ji Wupeng's true identity,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.770
[New Leader of Wudang Sect, Dafeng]
[New Abbot of Shaolin Sect, Tianxiang]

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.430
rid the martial world of evil,

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.870
and prevented us from being deceived

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.320
by that unforgivable criminal
of the martial world.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.360
We're grateful for that, Senior.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.480
But may I ask what brings you

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.390
here today, Senior?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.860
Back then, Tianzheng and Taichan

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.930
possessed such courage and majesty.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.320
But since those two,

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.600
none of you have shown any real ability
to make a mark.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.410
If you don't unite soon,

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.370
disaster will surely befall you.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.800
Today, I've come

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:02.710
to deliver a message,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.490
to convey
what Tianzheng and Taichan wished

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.030
to you younger generations.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.090
From now on, Wudang's martial skills

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.190
must be shared with Shaolin,

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.790
and Shaolin's martial skills

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.590
must also be shared with Wudang.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.480
Only by doing so
can this great calamity be averted.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.200
This...

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.550
Shaolin's martial skills
are profound and extensive.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:30.320
I often seek guidance
from Master Tianxiang

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.980
on Shaolin's
external martial arts techniques

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.510
and have benefited greatly.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.910
However, combining
different martial arts styles together

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.320
is a major taboo for martial artists.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.910
Shaolin is Shaolin,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.480
and Wudang is Wudang.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.630
The two sects can join forces
against enemies,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.480
but no matter how friendly we are,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.320
we would never exchange martial skills.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.030
Nonsense!

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.080
The true taboo in martial cultivation

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.580
is working in isolation, refusing to adapt
and narrow-mindedness.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.840
Wudang's martial arts

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.150
value internal cultivation,

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.570
while Shaolin focuses on
external techniques.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.200
Together, you two sects

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.720
can learn from each other

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.720
and become each other's greatest aid.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.630
You want Shaolin to learn techniques
from Wudang?

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.660
No.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.070
Never!

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:17.480
Never?

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.250
Then make your move.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:25.000
Senior Yan.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.770
We're here to mediate,

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:27.650
not to fight.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.730
Watch carefully from the side.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.210
This is what
true martial arts fusion looks like.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:42.700
Watch my move!

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.480
Shaolin's ultimate technique,
the Great Hand Seal.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.070
This is our Wudang Sect's skill,

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.150
the Canhe Finger Technique.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.450
How about that?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.350
Wudang plus Shaolin

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.840
is much stronger than
either one alone, isn't it?

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.720
Amitabha.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.650
There are always greater people
and higher powers beyond.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.130
Senior,

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.080
I'm enlightened.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.760
I'd also like to request
some guidance from you, Senior.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.780
You're not convinced either?

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:47.760
Come on then.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.250
Draw your sword.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.920
I can conserve my energy

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.380
and still converse with you effortlessly.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.840
Being a hero is about righteousness.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.350
It means even though you know
you shouldn't do something,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.750
you still do it out of righteousness.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.320
Helping the weak

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.510
with one's own strength

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.440
makes one a hero.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.870
And one who inspires
thousands of heroes to uphold justice

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.800
deserves to be called a great hero.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:18.240
Can your Wudang's internal energy

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.370
achieve this level?

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.240
Only by learning from others' strengths
to make up for your own weaknesses

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.040
can you escape the limits of
a narrow perspective.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.610
Which technique did I employ just now

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.370
when I struck your acupoint?

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.720
It's Wudang's 39 Bridges
with Unified Nod technique.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.410
With elements borrowed from
Shaolin's staff techniques.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.860
I admit defeat.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.320
Even if I drew my sword,

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.440
I would be no match for you, Senior.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.570
Please rise.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.570
Thank you, Senior.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.330
Given your current position,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.530
you accept defeat gracefully

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.670
without a single word of complaint.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.910
The Wudang and Shaolin Sects
truly produce exceptional talents.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.870
Given time,

00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:32.890
you'll surely be on par with
Tianzheng and Taichan.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.910
We juniors have yet to train enough.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.370
If the leaders of Shaolin
and our sect were still around today,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.930
I believe
they wouldn't disappoint you, Senior.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.810
If those two were still around,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.840
they surely wouldn't be
as stubborn as you are.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.040
What exactly are you thinking?

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.240
Do you really want others

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.870
to master and combine
your two sects' techniques first

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:58.070
before you finally come to your senses?

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.790
Shaolin and Wudang Sects' martial skills
are profound and extensive.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.830
In this world,

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.880
besides you, Senior,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.260
who else could possibly master them all?

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.320
Senior,

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.380
aren't you worrying unnecessarily?

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.360
It's beyond unnecessary worry.

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:17.870
It's complete nonsense.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.630
It's beyond nonsense.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.510
It's completely delusional.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.150
It's beyond delusion.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.030
It's absolute rubbish.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.650
Who would have thought that

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.670
the three masters of Wudang Sect,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.480
Jiusheng, Jiusi, and Jiuyi,

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.080
actually survived?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.780
And you're even living a leisurely life
here in the mountains.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.320
Not just the three of us.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.890
Shaolin's five monks: Feng, Hua, Xue,
Yue, and Can.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.890
They also survived, didn't they?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.580
It seems quite a few masters
from both sects have survived.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.510
It's just that I wonder
if you three still remember

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.030
our battle from years ago.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:10.990
Of course we still remember.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.320
Back then, the three of us

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.790
were indeed defeated by you.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.310
But when it comes to the martial skills
of Shaolin and Wudang,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.790
you, Mr. Yan, may not necessarily

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.600
be a match for the three of us.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.610
Words alone prove nothing.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.430
Why not put it to the test?

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.790
It's been a long time since we've fought.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.080
I'm afraid that in the days to come,

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:37.300
there will be no opponent
worthy of us making a move.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.320
Senior Yan!

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.720
Senior.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.000
You once said

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.960
if everyone in the martial world
only strives to be the best

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.290
and cannot unite as one,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.480
how will Daxi ever have a future?

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.829
The martial world of Daxi
will also cease to exist.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.440
Fine.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.770
I'll listen to you on this.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.730
After all, I've said
all I came here to say today.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.550
It wasn't in vain that I shared a bond
with Tianzheng and Taichan

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.720
all these years.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.480
As the top fighter in the martial world,

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.310
you're truly deserving of the title.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:45.240
Even if we only use
Shaolin and Wudang techniques,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.400
we might not be able to win.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.720
You must be Xiao Qiushui.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.120
I've heard that Mr. Xiao's martial skills
and character are both exceptional.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.210
You flatter me, Senior.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.240
The Northern Wasteland
has planted spies in Daxi,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.510
who are causing tragedies

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:05.710
and inciting conflicts between sects.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.070
The Fei family's
Thousand-Faces Mask has been exploited,

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.350
and many sects have been implicated.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.920
What Senior Yan said today

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.510
is exactly what I've been thinking.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.550
I ask that Wudang and Shaolin
join forces against our enemies.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.720
So you also believe that
Wudang can defeat Shaolin,

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.570
and Shaolin can defeat Wudang as well?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.160
Only by mastering the strengths
of the two sects,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.550
using diverse fighting techniques

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.790
and knowing the enemy's
advantages and flaws,

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.120
can one hope to prevail.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.310
Mr. Xiao,

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.550
you're the unanimously chosen
Alliance Leader at the Heroes' Gathering.

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.110
You bear the responsibility of
leading the martial world

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.960
in rescuing General Wu.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.510
However,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.000
this is not enough to prove

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.970
that Shaolin and Wudang
must exchange techniques.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.200
Only if you can use
Shaolin and Wudang Sects' techniques

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.240
to take three strikes from us

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.550
will Wudang consider your suggestion,
Alliance Leader.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.960
Amitabha.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.000
Shaolin agrees as well.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.720
Qiushui.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.170
If you truly mean what you say,

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:12.520
then show them

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.200
that your words are genuine.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.480
Senior Yan.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.110
Must the truth

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.070
be proven this way?

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.640
Don't you know

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.170
that many truths in this world

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:34.720
are established with fists?

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:40.740
Senior Ya...

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.880
Please go easy on me, respected seniors.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.830
Young man,
your martial skills are exceptional.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.230
No need for formalities.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.160
These three moves

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.690
seem ordinary on their own,

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.220
but together
they form a powerful formation.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:16.110
Xiao Qiushui,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.180
how will you counter this?

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.370
The second move now.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.200
Using Wudang's
Nine-Cycle Internal Technique

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.110
against Wudang's Celestial Palm,

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.070
using softness to overcome hardness.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:03.730
Brilliant!

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.540
The final move now.

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.370
If you can't defeat Xiao Qiushui,

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:10.870
you'll be considered defeated.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.710
Five-Finger Heart Connection.
Five petals forming a lotus!

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.370
Isn't this just
Shaolin combined with Wudang?

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.510
I've lost.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.510
I can't figure out
how to counter this move.

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880
You haven't lost.

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:14.040
We used
the Five-Finger Heart Connection.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.310
This technique
belongs not to Shaolin alone,

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.480
nor to Wudang alone.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:22.840
It's precisely a technique
jointly created by Shaolin and Wudang.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.110
We realized we couldn't defeat you,

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:27.550
so we were forced to use it.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.750
You actually won.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.610
Respected seniors,

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.790
your insight is truly remarkable.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:38.350
Young man, you have a noble heart
and care for the world.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.490
Heroes emerge from the young.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.600
This saying is true indeed.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.350
In today's martial world,

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:46.480
it's you young people who matter most.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.440
We're just a bunch of old bones now.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.300
There's indeed no need for us
to continue fighting.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.880
Seniors, you're being too modest.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:03.610
What have you learned?

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:08.640
I told you

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.280
this journey would benefit you.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.110
I've taken the Herbal King's poison

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.720
and will transfer it to Father
using my internal energy.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.720
I wonder if this poison transfer method

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.200
will work.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.480
Father!

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.830
Father!

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.110
Fang.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.070
I'm alright.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.320
Then have some rest, Father.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.990
[Heroes of Our Era]

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.000
Back then, Tianzheng, Taichan, and Zhichen

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.920
established this stele right here

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.270
and created the Hero Command Token.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.110
So this is where

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.070
you defeated all those heroes

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:55.840
and obtained the Hero Command Token,
Senior.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.840
With this journey to Wudang,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.730
my wish has been fulfilled.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:02.460
After I get one more thing done,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:04.790
I'll return the Hero Command Token to you.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.720
Do you see that thing?

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.530
Back when the martial world was in chaos,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.350
I came here specifically

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.400
to draw a turtle,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.940
which nearly drove that old man Taichan
to death with anger.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.680
I never thought

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.770
you had such a playful spirit, Senior.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:36.000
Rather than erecting this stele in vain,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.640
it'd be better to show
the so-called heroes of the world

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:41.030
what a bunch of cowards they really are.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.960
By the way,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.540
I heard you formed something called
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.720
I hope that in the martial world,

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.030
someone like you will make a difference.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.270
Perhaps your name

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.100
will one day be carved on this stele,

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.630
as a true hero.

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.640
What I do

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.720
is not to make a name for myself

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:09.230
in the martial world.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.010
Just like you did in your time, Senior.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.640
Good lad.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.880
I like that.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.880
The journey in this martial world

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.550
is not only about
flamboyant spree and jubilation.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:25.550
You should live up to justice,

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.550
look down without shame to earth,

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:29.200
move in line with righteousness,

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.730
and stay true to your heart.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.430
If I can achieve that,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.710
then my journey in this world
will not be in vain.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:38.510
Well said.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.310
I can say my life hasn't been wasted.

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.150
Thank you for your help, Senior.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.710
Now, two streams of internal energy
are colliding within me.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.550
Shaolin and Wudang's martial arts styles

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.240
embody opposing principles—
one is hard, the other gentle.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.750
Did you bring me here today

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.830
to give me some kind of hint, Senior?

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.520
You're smart.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.150
Now that you've realized it,

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.440
why not give it a try?

Senior Yan.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:15.340
Father.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:20.960
Father!

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.660
Tang Song.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.440
Shouldn't you be...

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.420
Fang.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.000
I heard you worked really hard
to treat your father,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.780
so I came specially to check on him.

00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:52.910
Why are you so cold?

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.940
What do you want to do to my father?

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:55.580
Let him go!

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.660
Fang, don't get worked up.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.840
The poison is already clouding your mind.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:02.160
If your anger flares again,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.090
I fear you may spiral into madness.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.550
Fang.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.030
Don't worry about me!

Tang Song.

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:13.790
How dare you hurt Master?

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:16.850
Aren't you worried
Old Madam Tang will punish you?

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.680
You don't actually think

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.010
I'm afraid of that dying old woman,
do you?

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.520
Rest assured.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.110
I'll deal with her sooner or later.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.880
I'll handle you all

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:30.480

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.260

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:41.590

Old hag.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.030
I already poisoned you with
the Bone-Softening Incense.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.670
The poison activates as soon as
you use your martial skills.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.650
You wretched creature!

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.590

Yes!

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.290
You old fossil.

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.070
You've controlled
the Tang Sect for decades.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.730
Stuck in your old ways all day.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.370
Since you lack the ability to lead,

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:50.250
you might as well hand over
the Tang Sect Token to me.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.560
I'll make the Tang Sect prosper.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.680
Get the Tang Sect Token now.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.190
Mere Bone-Softening Incense.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.600
Don't think you can take me down
just like that.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.630
No way.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.090
How can this be?

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:42.150
Seize her now!

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.530
Don't worry.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.670
Where am I?

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:02.190
Mr. Yan, please don't move.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:04.230
You suddenly collapsed at Wudang Square.

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.130
I guess your old illness flared up,

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:08.030
so I brought you back for treatment.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:09.630
How are you feeling now?

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:12.230
Who is she?

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.030
This is my older sister, Xiao Xueyu.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:20.370
Xueyu.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.160
How's Senior Yan's condition now?

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.800
A nail was thrust into
the back of Mr. Yan's neck,

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800
driven with profound internal energy,

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.200
reaching his meridians.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.960
Normally he only feels pain,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.900
but now it has affected
multiple meridians.

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.800
Ordinary treatment can only address
the symptoms, not the root of the problem.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.200
Only by removing the nail

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.810
can we completely eliminate the danger.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:46.600
This is all the doing of
that venomous scoundrel from Tang Sect.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:48.800
Senior.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.170
I've roamed the martial world,

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.030
unrivaled under heaven,

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.230
and few could ever harm me.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.760
Yet in that battle at Wuxing Mountain,

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:07.500
Tang Yaoshun ambushed me
with the Soul-Piercing Nail.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.230
His skills are formidable.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.550
Senior,

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.640
I'm willing to help you remove this nail.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.490
I've already given you

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.760
the Agarwood Energy-Harmonizing Pill.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.490
The medicine has taken effect.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.760
Your vital energy should be balanced now.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.360
Senior,

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.730
you might as well give it a try.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:34.230
Senior.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.330
Qiushui.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.960
Then I'll trouble you with this.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.550
Alright.

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.520
Senior, pardon me.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.120
It's fine. Continue.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:19.690
Pardon me, Senior.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.630
Senior.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:51.630
This Soul-Piercing Nail actually fused
our internal energies together,

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:54.560
and the nail only goes deeper
when I try to pull it out.

00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.030
Let it be.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.150
This nail has been with me for years.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.360
It has already grown into my marrow.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.290
If we leave it in,

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.580
I'll just feel dizzy and weak.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:08.250
Some rest will take care of it.

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.040
If we really try to remove it,

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:11.710
it might cost me my life.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.520
Senior, don't worry.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.920
I'm sure I can find a solution.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.480
Whatever you do,
don't go to the Tang Sect.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.610
I'd rather die than accept their help.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.400
Qiushui,

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.860
let's step outside

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:24.530
so that Senior could rest.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.800
Okay.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.550
Tang Fang.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.000
Pour me some tea.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:41.880
This puppet-control needle

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:43.760
works so well.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.110
Tang Fang.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.660
Those precious hidden weapons
and poisons of yours

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:02.480
and all those things
Old Madam Tang gave you

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.960
are of no use to you now.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.220
Why don't you hand them over to me?

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.710
You've always had all the good stuff
since childhood.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.490
Didn't expect this,

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.710
did you?

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.110
Stop fooling around.
