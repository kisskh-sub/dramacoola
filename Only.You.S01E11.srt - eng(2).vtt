Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.120
But Mek is still Mek.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.840
I just can't put any hope in him.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.440
Who's the frontrunner
for this bidding round?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.240
I don't care what tricks
you're planning to use.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.640
But I will win this bid.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.880
Did you see the photo I sent?

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.760
The choice is yours, Mr. Thana.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.960
Pull us out of the bidding. Now.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.200
Tawan!

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
Put the gun down.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.320
You laid a hand on my woman.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.039
Tawan! Stop, stop!

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.400
Ayla.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.080
I'm okay.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.560
Thank you, Tawan.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.720
If it weren't for you,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.760
who knows what would've happened to Ayla.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.120
I'm willing to protect her.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.200
For everyone's safety,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.160
may I add more of my team
to look after you and Ayla?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.680
Of course. Please do.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.520
Chanya.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.640
Understood, Boss.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.760
Ayla, go on inside.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.040
You need to go to the hospital
right after, okay?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.360
-Boss!
-Boss!

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.000
-Let's go.
-Boss.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.520
Get in the car, Boss.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.960
Careful, Boss.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.120
It's all taken care of.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.240
Luckily, the bullet only grazed her.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.240
But she did lose a lot of blood.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.240
I've given her supplements.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.640
Thank you so much, Doctor.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.920
Hello, Nana? How's Tawan?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.480
She's safe.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.360
The medicine's taken effect,
and she's asleep now.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.600
And what hospital is she at?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.120
Well…

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.760
Nana…

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.040
At the office.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.120
But don't worry.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.760
The doctor's already checked on her.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.880
It was just a graze.
Nothing lodged inside.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.480
If anything happens,

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.680
you can call me anytime, 24 hours.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.960
I will.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.120
Nana, please don't get annoyed with me.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.840
How could I ever be annoyed
at the woman Boss loves most?

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.480
I just…

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.600
I'm really worried about her.
But I don't know what to do.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.200
I can't even be by her side
when I want to.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.720
I can't do anything.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.160
I feel like I'm a terrible girlfriend.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.680
Want some advice from me?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.160
If it were me,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.480
and there was a woman I loved,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.120
she wouldn't need to protect me at all.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.160
Just being there,
ready to hold my hand when I fall,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.880
to help me through…

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.520
That alone would be happiness enough.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.400
Think about it, Ms. Ayla.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.200
Love yourself first,
then, when you're strong,

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.920
you can go back and love her fully,
so that you'll be loved in return.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.720
Stay calm. You have to stay calm.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.000
Being the girlfriend of a bodyguard
means you need to stay calm.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.040
I'll stay calm.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.840
Thank you, Nana.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.840
OUR LITTLE SECRET, OKAY?
I DON'T WANT TO DIE

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.720
Dad.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.000
Go get dressed, sweetheart.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.000
I'm taking you to see Tawan.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.480
Dad… Thank you…

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.560
I love you.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.680
Are you getting up?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.520
How's your wound? Still hurting?

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.320
It's nothing.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.040
But…

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.000
how did you get here?

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.240
Dad dropped me off.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.120
He finally let me come take care of you.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.840
Want some water?
I'll get it for you. Just a sec.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.240
No need. I'm not thirsty.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.600
Not an option. You need to drink water--

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.120
Or eat something!

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.680
I have rice porridge.
Hold on. I'll get it.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.840
Wait…

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.160
Did you…

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.000
make it…

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.320
or buy it?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.200
Made it myself.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.760
Here.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.720
It's good!

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.560
Good, right?

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.440
Because I bought it.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.800
I've never had porridge this good before.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.640
For me?

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.920
Try some.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.360
Since you got sick,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.600
you've gotten so sweet, huh?

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.240
Sweet, am I?

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.640
Sweet only for you.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.400
Is that true?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.560
Anyway, I should put this bowl away.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.280
Time for your medicine.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.640
Not going to feed me?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.600
I have to feed you medicine too?

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.720
I'm hurt.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.480
No strength left.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.560
You'll taste the bitterness.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.840
Let me put the bowl away first.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.720
I haven't finished the medicine.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.400
You have. There's nothing left.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.280
There is. This one.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.000
The elixir of life.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.680
All she did was bring porridge.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.680
We shouldn't be nosy
about the Boss' stuff, right?

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.400
But I kind of am.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.520
How long now?

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.800
It's been a while now.

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.880
Geez!

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.960
What are you two sneaking around for, huh?

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.640
It hurts?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.760
Of course, it hurts!
You always hit us hardest.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.120
Ugh, it rattled my brain.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.720
Straight to my cerebellum.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.000
-Can't function.
-Oh, stop it.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.120
You're overreacting.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.920
You two are built like tanks.
You can't feel a thing.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.080
It did hurt though.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.600
Got a bump.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.000
So…

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.000
What are you doing here?
You look suspicious.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.200
Well…

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.520
-What?
-Ms. Ayla

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.360
went up with porridge.
But it's been a while.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.440
Yeah, a while.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.200
Long enough for us to worry.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.920
-And?
-And…

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.840
And we're their subordinates.
Of course, we worry about Boss.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.240
What if she needs help or something?

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.000
That's it.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.760
Nonsense. If she needs something,
don't you think she'll call?

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.000
Nest two, report.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.600
Wait up!

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.400
No one's allowed
up to the Eagle's Nest. Repeat.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.320
Absolutely no entry.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.360
Copy that.

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.720
-Whoa!
-Whoa! What?

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.920
What are you even hanging around for?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.800
Go! Go back to work.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:59.040
If they want to sweet-talk
each other, let them.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.240
With care like that, Boss
will be back on her feet in no time.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.680
Go on.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760
-We're worried.
-Okay, okay.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.119
Just worried.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.880
Now what are you doing, huh?

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.440
Ayla.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.360
Oh!

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.960
Why are you getting up?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.400
Lie down properly.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.680
You're looking much better today.
Everythings seems normal.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.560
Any headaches or body aches?

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.960
None.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.240
Right this way, please.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.760
Thank you.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.200
Good job!

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.520
Good job, Boss.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.400
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD DIRECTORS

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.520
A pleasure working with you.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.760
Don't worry, I'll see this project through
to the best of my ability.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.080
Of course.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.320
The bidding was handled well.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
The board should be satisfied.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.840
Good job.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.960
You can count on me, Dad.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.600
From now on, I won't let you down again.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.600
See? When you give something

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.200
your full focus and effort,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.640
the results always follow.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160
Yes.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.440
Dad, how about we celebrate tonight?

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.280
Just you and me.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.840
I'll book a place right now.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.520
Mek.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.200
For everything, I'm sorry.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.480
All this time,
I never trusted or believed in you.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.480
Sometimes I even spoke harshly.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.360
It's alright, Dad.
You don't need to worry about me.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.120
Keep working hard.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.440
Show the board what you can do.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.720
At the end of the year, I'm making you
vice president of our company.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.200
You mean it, Dad?

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.760
Thank you, Dad.

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.000
I'll give it everything I've got.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.800
Just wait and see.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.440
Thank you.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.440
Tonight, close up the bar early.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.600
After dinner with my father,

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.600
I'll come by to celebrate
with everyone. Special occasion.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.120
Of course.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.280
And hey, no sneaking off before sunrise!

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.360
What?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.920
Oh.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.120
Alright, see you then.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.960
Mr. Mek.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I'm hanging up now.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.160
You scared the hell out of me.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.320
Here to collect your reward, huh?

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.000
No problem. You did well this time.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.600
SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER
1,000,000 BAHT

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:33.040
Done.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840
Thank you, sir.

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.000
Hey. Not even going to check?
That's a hefty sum.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.400
No need, sir.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.240
Anything else?

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.400
No, nothing else.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:53.400
Then go.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.320
Yes, sir.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400
Get going.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.520
The number you've dialed
cannot be connected at this time.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.040
Why can't I get through?

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.640
Keep your eyes on everyone
in the Chokprasertsap family.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.440
That's your old family name, isn't it?

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.840
Send word to Mr. Thana.
Tell him to lie low.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.040
I don't want them to know they failed.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.560
At a time like this,
we can't trust anyone.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.160
Boss.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.600
And if what you're thinking
turns out to be true,

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.920
what will you do?

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.360
Then it'll be to the death.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.400
I don't think things
will get that bad, Boss.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.520
Let's hope not.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.520
I'd hate to despise my own blood.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.760
T.S. CONSTRUCTION WINS MAJOR BID
MULTI-BILLION REAL ESTATE PROJECT SECURED

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.880
Documents from T.S. Construction
you left downstairs.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.720
T.S. Construction sent over
some additional files, Boss.

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.440
‎ANNUAL MEETING SUMMARY 2025
‎ANNUAL MEETING SUMMARY 2018-2020

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.720
Couldn't sleep?

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.120
No.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.720
Must've napped too much during the day.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.280
What about you?

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.280
Why are you up?

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.760
Woke up and you weren't there,

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.280
so I came looking.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.520
What's wrong? You look tense.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.240
No. Nothing.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.320
Just worried.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.360
Worried?

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.000
About what?

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.040
Don't be.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.520
Rest up first, okay?

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.120
Honestly, I'm already feeling much better.

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.920
Or…

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.440
Should I…

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.160
-carry…
-No, no!

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.200
No way!

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.200
You'll tear your stitches.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.920
Fine.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.280
I won't be stubborn with my girl.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.360
Good. You've earned Best Girlfriend award.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.120
Now, come on. Back to bed.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.440
Alright, alright.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.200
Close your eyes.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.320
Eyes closed means mind shut too.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.320
No more thinking, okay?

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.600
Roger that.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.720
Then why are your eyes open?

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.720
Sleep.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.440
What is it? Three, four…

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.440
Don't get confused. Slide over.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:52.920
One, two, three!

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.040
What was that?

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.160
You won?

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.320
Yay!

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.800
Victory!

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.240
You won!

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.720
Haven't played like this in a long time.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.200
You're drenched. Tired?

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.600
Just a little. It was fun though.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.480
Thank you.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.840
Boss Lady.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.080
The way you were playing just now--

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.160
Wait, what did you just call me?

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.520
Boss Lady.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.000
Please don't mind him, Ms. Ayla.

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.280
His mouth runs ahead of his brain.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.800
Exactly, he always blabs.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.440
Not at all.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.880
Good talk!

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.440
I actually like that word, Boss Lady!

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:07.560
In that case, shouldn't we call Tawan

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:09.720
Big Bro too?

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.200
Big Bro! Ooh, Big Bro!

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.400
Big Bro, Big Bro!

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.480
Big Bro, Big Bro!

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.160
Big Bro's clenching his fists…

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.800
Nope, nope! Bad idea!

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.640
-Not good.
-Very unlucky.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.160
Boss would never like that.
Doesn't suit her.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.160
What should we call her?

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.960
Better stick to Boss.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.080
-Boss.
-Yes.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.600
Much better, right, Boss?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.200
Mr. Thawat, correct?

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.600
Yes. What is this about, Officer?

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.720
I'll have to ask you
to come with us to the station.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.680
You're a suspect in the abduction

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.720
of Ms. Sasina Ruengkunakorn.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.840
Please cooperate.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.680
Yes.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.560
Thank you so much.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.000
Boss,

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.160
we've got more leads on the culprit.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.240
Ayla,

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.320
give me a moment. I need
to discuss something with Typhoon.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.760
Alright.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.360
These are the names of the suspects
and several persons of interest.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.760
The one we believe
to be the middleman is Thawat.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.120
PEOPLE LINKED TO MR. THAWAT THAMMA

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.920
And this photo shows him

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.680
following Mr. Mek at the company.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.080
And this is the proof
of a large money transfer

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.480
from Mr. Mek to Thawat,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.160
a big sum.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.080
SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.880
And the most important thing
is that it happened

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.760
right after Mr. Songklod's
company won the bid.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.960
And here, evidence
of Ms. Ayla being held hostage.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.520
It all

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.800
points straight at Mr. Mek

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.440
as the one who hired Thawat.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.840
But Boss,

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:21.920
this could also be a setup,
making him the scapegoat.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.320
Is it?

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.640
But the evidence seems clear enough.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.720
Where are you going, Boss?

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.560
Boss.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.120
Please, wait for the police.

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:46.960
-Typhoon, stand--
-No.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.000
Trust me, Boss. Don't go.

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.040
I said stand down!

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.520
Tawan!

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.480
I know who the culprit is.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.840
I forced them to tell me.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.760
Don't blame them.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.639
Where are you going?

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.320
I'm going to deal with Mek myself.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.199
For the bad things he did.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.679
Why not leave it to the police?

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.520
Because I need to see him suffer
by my own hand.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.719
He hurt you, he'll pay for it.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.880
But I'm fine.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.719
See? I'm not hurt anymore.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:03.720
Please, leave it to the police.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.440
Please?

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.880
Please, my love…

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.520
Will you do this for me?

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.600
Typhoon.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.640
Yes.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.160
Notify me the second
the warrant for Mek is issued.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:52.600
Understood.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.200
You all can head back now.
I'll take care of her from here.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.560
Alright.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.000
Let me see that.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.760
Looks like Boss went easy on you.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.760
Otherwise, you'd be wrecked.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.520
You're probably right.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.760
Don't know what's going on upstairs.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.120
I've never seen Boss this angry
in a long time.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.120
Terrifying.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.200
I'm a man, and even I was shaken.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.800
Good thing Ms. Ayla was there.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.720
If she hadn't stopped her,
Mr. Mek would be done for.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.120
Either dead or not worth keeping alive.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.720
Ms. Ayla is the only one
who can calm her down.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.840
Makes me wonder who's luckier.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.240
Boss, for having Ms. Ayla…

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.640
Or Ms. Ayla, for having her.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.000
I'd say both.
They're complete opposites, but together…

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.520
it's perfect.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.280
Like…

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.000
Like they were made

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.800
for each other only.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.840
Isn't that

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.760
what they call… soulmates?

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.560
Soulmates,

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.000
tested by fire.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.560
Does it hurt?

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.080
The wound or my heart?

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.520
Both.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.800
The wound doesn't.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.880
But my heart…

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:53.200
Then let me heal both,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.800
for the wound

00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.560
and for your heart.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.120
Let's start with your heart, shall we?

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.400
And now, the wound.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.040
You know,

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.800
when a bodyguard holds a gun,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.880
it means someone has to survive.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.920
But when a hitman holds a gun,

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.120
it means someone must die.

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.760
So many times people have hurt you.

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.000
And in those moments, I'd rather
be the hitman than the bodyguard.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.240
Because I want to kill them.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:06.280
Just because others are cruel

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.040
doesn't mean you have to be cruel too.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.440
Don't go to the dark side
because of me, Tawan.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.280
I've tried to protect you from everyone.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.280
But my own family,

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.640
the ones who share my blood,

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.800
they're the ones who hurt you.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.520
He can hurt me and I'll take it.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:42.000
But when he hurts you,

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.760
the person I love most,

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.440
I can't forgive that.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.440
Either he dies or I do.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.000
Death doesn't solve everything.

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.560
Let karma do its work.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.160
What they've done will come back to them.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.480
That's better than blood for blood.

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.880
The feud in my family…

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.280
I don't know how it will ever end.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.840
In my father's time, my father hurt yours.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.560
Now, in our generation,

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:02.160
my brother hurts you.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.320
I don't know

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:12.600
what I'm supposed to do anymore.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.520
No matter what happens,

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.320
I'll always be right here,

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.640
by your side. Forever.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.720
-Hey!
-Tawan!

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.520
That daughter of a mistress,
whatever she does, you're always pleased.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.840
Why don't you make Mek hate me too?

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.520
Why are you apologizing for him?

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.640
Make him kneel before me!

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.560
If you can't fix this problem,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:19.680
then there might not be
a T.S. Construction anymore.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.720
What is it you really want from me?

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.280
Will you sit here
and watch over me while I'm singing?

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.800
