How's the chairman doing now?

I'm here today to call

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.150
and chair this meeting
on my husband's behalf.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.240
I really didn't expect

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.150
the news
about my husband's hospitalization

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.960

expecting him to come out
and sign anything

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.680
is just a pipe dream.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.800
The pressure
from the shareholders is constant.

We need to find a solution fast.

If the leader is absent,

So, who do you think is suitable?

If no one has an answer,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.560
then I propose Yi Wenhan be considered

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.800

Why can't I be here?

This is supposed to be a meeting
for middle and senior management, right?

I am both a company employee

Ms. Nie suggests Yi Wenhan
is the most suitable candidate.

I don't know what everyone else thinks,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.750
but personally, I believe
anyone who suggests this

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.800
and thinks Yi Wenhan's suitable

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.960
is utterly foolish.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.000
Right now, we all have just one goal.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.870

and reputation.

Besides, Zhizhi,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.300
your share percentage

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.300
isn't large.

In comparison,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.260
Xiaofei is much more sensible.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.540
She's already agreed
to transfer her shares

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.980
to Yi Wenhan.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.580
Everyone else understands
and is fully supportive.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.660
Of course, the control of the company

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.580
should go to the person
with the largest share percentage.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.700
And currently,
Yi Wenhan's share percentage

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.700
is larger than yours.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.100
I don't think this needs
much more discussion.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.060
But since you object,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.780
we can schedule another meeting
to discuss it.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.700
Fine.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.620
We'll announce the selection next week.

The person
with the largest share percentage

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.740
wins.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.340
Do you agree?

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.500
Next time you try to cause trouble,

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.380
get your facts straight.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.460
You can make stupid mistakes yourself.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.540
But don't drag
the Song family down with you.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.380
That's all for today.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.100

She doesn't recognize me.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.900
She must have had a shock.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.220
Her emotions have been very unstable.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.460
Her memory comes and goes too.

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:38.020
So can she recover?

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.980
It's hard to say.

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:41.900
The doctors said

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.220
giving her a comfortable,
peaceful environment,

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.820
along with medication,

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:49.380
can hopefully keep her condition

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.140
from getting worse.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.480
[Dad]

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:08.860
Hey, Dad?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.400
I asked you to look into

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.280
the rough gemstone purchase
from back then.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.140
Where did you disappear to?

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.140
I had a last-minute business trip.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:14.980
I'll be back later.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.900
Mom.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.500
It's been so long.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.740
Why can't I announce

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.580
that Wenhan and I have broken up?

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.580
Look, my posters got taken down.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.100
My fans are leaving.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.980
They say I'm boy-crazy
and have no ambition.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.460
Xiaofei,

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.020
this is a critical period
for your brother's fight

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.140
with Song Zhizhi for control.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.100
We can't afford
any negative media attention.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.340
I promise you,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.740
once things calm down,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.740
the endorsements will come your way.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.740
But Mom, my career is also on the rise.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.340
Xiaofei, you're great in every way,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.820
but you're just too self-centered.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:12.980
Your career is important, of course.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.500
But isn't our family's happiness
more important?

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.380
Fine.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.700
I'll help you get in touch

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.500
with some overseas agencies.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.580
But are these
so-called overseas connections

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.740
really useful?

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.660
What can your mere acquaintances

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.900
from the parties really do?

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:33.420
Whether my connections
are useful or not

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.780
isn't for you to decide.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.300
Your job right now is
to support your brother

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.940
and help us succeed in our plan.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:40.980
Understood?

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:45.580
Since you won't help me,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.500
I'll figure it out myself.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.220
Have something to eat.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:37.940
Ms. Wu brought it.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.860
With Grandma like this,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.260
how can I have an appetite?

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.580
Being back here

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.780
reminds me of when I was little,

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.060
with Dad, Zhiyan,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:57.820
and Grandma.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.460
Such happy times.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:05.500
But

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.260
how did it all turn out like this?

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.020
I understand how you feel.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.980
I've been there.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.380
My mother was a very gentle

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.900
and kind person.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.660
But I lost her in an accident.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.060
I couldn't accept it at the time.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.220
I even felt like life had lost
all meaning.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.300
But later, I came to realize it.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.460
I needed to move on.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.620
Look at me now,
running Jihong Group.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.580
I think if she knew,

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.820
she'd be proud of me.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:00.860
So Zhizhi,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.180
you need to be strong
and brave through all this.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.020
You can do it too.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.980
I wish I were as capable as you.

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.620
If you need anything,

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.180
I'll help you.

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:41.420
Going back means
another tough battle ahead.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.980
Someone just vowed

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.300
they were ready to fight.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.340
But they're so ruthless.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:51.980
They'll stop at nothing

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.900
for money and profit.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.860
The family I once believed in

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.100
has now fallen apart.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.620
Grandma and Dad have fallen ill.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.780
I just want to protect my dad's company.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.500
Why is it so hard?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:14.620
Don't worry.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.580
I will help you.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.020

why weren't you answering your phone?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.980

the overseas companies?

What did Xiaofei say?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.580
She said some overseas company

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.220
wants to sign her for an endorsement.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.220
Has she signed already?

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:21.140
Not yet.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.540
But it's clear

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.820
she really wants to.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.980
And Song Zhizhi is nowhere to be found.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.180
The family car and driver are here.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.820
But she's not responding

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:41.020
to my messages.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:45.740
Right now, shares are
the most important for Song Zhizhi.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.300
Is it possible

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.460
she went to her grandmother
to ask for her shares?

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.380
Very possible.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:55.740
Wenhan,

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.540
go talk some sense into Xiaofei
and bring her back.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.620
I'll deal with Song Zhizhi.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:18.860

Zhizhi,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.660
I'm getting old.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.900
My health isn't what it used to be.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.900
Your father is also unwell.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.180
Zhiyan can be a bit willful.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.380
And you, poor girl,

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.540
lost your mother so young.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.300
I can tell

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.740
Nie Wenzhi has ulterior motives.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.740
While I'm still here, I can protect you.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:16.580
If there comes a day

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.980
when I can no longer protect you,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:20.620
I'm afraid the burden

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.580
of this family
will fall on your shoulders.

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.340
Although I really wish

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.660
you could remain a carefree girl forever

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.860
and never have to open this letter.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.180
I was afraid something might happen,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.420
so I prepared
this share transfer agreement

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.500
for you in advance.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:47.900
[Share Transfer Agreement]
I know if you've come here,

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.620
you must be facing some difficulty.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.660
Hope I can help you one last time.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.900
Hello, it's me.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.900
I'm feeling a bit uneasy.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.300
Song Zhizhi went to see Qin Xiuyun.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.020
She's probably already gotten
her shares.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:35.980
Yes.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.260
She's also acquired

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.540
some shares in the company.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.060
To be safe,

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.100
we should just make sure she can't
attend this shareholders' meeting.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.220
Understood.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.500
Mom, I'm back.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.580
Mom,

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.220
I contacted an overseas agency.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.300
They have a very important show

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.140
they want me for.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.980
But it's quite urgent.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.060
I need to leave in a couple of days.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.500
I wanted to discuss it with you.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:25.700
There's nothing to discuss.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.860
You are not going.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.540
Why?

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.740
Because the shareholders' meeting
is crucial.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.980
You know every shareholder
must be present.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.260
If you're not there,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.700
what about our vote?

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:43.380
But this opportunity
is important to me too!

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:45.660
I earned this myself!

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:48.180
You don't have to help me,
but don't stand in my way!

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:53.660
Alright, alright.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.780
I support your dreams.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.940
Let's talk this through.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.140
I support you.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.540
I just need you to do one thing for me

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.220
before you go abroad.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.260
Is...

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.980
Is that really necessary?

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.500
From what I know,

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.980
Song Zhizhi has already known

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.660
about your plans to go abroad.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.700
And she knows the owner
of the company

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.780
you're signing with.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.660
They're going to meet soon.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.460
And guess what they would do
if they met.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.580
I'm just worried

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.500
she might try to block
your path overseas.

00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.420
But...

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.660
Why would she?

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.740
Why?

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.060
Because you're more talented
than she is.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.460
Because you're a thorn in her side.

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:51.780
Xiaofei,

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.180
if I were you,

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.980
I'd never leave my enemies
any way out.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.660
Those who've harmed you
must be eliminated.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:05.060
Only then can you go abroad
and develop your career.

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:15.340
Hello?

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.420
We have a lead on the rough gemstones.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.140
Go to Italy

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.660
and find out who received
those rough gemstones

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:22.700
back then.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.220
Understood.

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:46.740
Zhizhi.

00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.420
I need to talk to you about something.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:51.660
What is it?

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.220
Does this necklace look nice?

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:57.660
It's pretty.

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.740
Can you help me put it on?

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:01.380
My nails are too long.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.340
It's tricky for me to do it.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.020
I'm afraid I might scratch it.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.140
Wenhan bought me this necklace.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.900
He said it's really hard
to find pearls of this Tennyo grade.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.780
He went through

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.020
a lot of trouble to get it.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.260
He just bought you this?

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.540
This is just
a regular saltwater pearl at best.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.780
Not Tennyo grade.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.460
It's already yellowing

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:43.460
and has obvious flaws.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.940
It's probably second-hand.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.940
What are you doing?

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.500
Song Zhizhi,

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.820
is it that in your eyes,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.660
everything I have is inferior

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.220
and flawed?

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.900
Stop acting so superior all the time!

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:03.100
Let me tell you,

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:04.980
the company will sign me,

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.700
and Wenhan loves me.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.140
Don't think you can easily ruin me!

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.580
Xiaofei. Xiaofei!

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:33.820
Xiaofei!

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:51.900
Xiaofei.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.180
Xiaofei!

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.500
This way, please.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:01.580
Xiaofei!

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.620
Xiaofei!

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.180
Xiaofei!

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.500
- Xiaofei!
- Xiaofei, what's wrong?

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.580
Xiaofei.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.340
- Xiaofei!
- Xiaofei, are you okay?

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:07.820
Xiaofei.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.700
Song Zhizhi,

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.380
why would you do this to Xiaofei?

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.060
What did she ever do to you?

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:14.300
Even if you two don't get along...

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:14.820
Xiaofei.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.220
you didn't have to ruin her!

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:16.980
I didn't!

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:17.820
Xiaofei.

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.260
Xiaofei!

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:19.900
Ma'am.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.940
- Xiaofei...
- What's wrong?

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.780
What happened?

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:23.940
I came in

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.060
and saw Xiaofei tumble down the stairs

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:27.180
right in front of Song Zhizhi.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.380
Song Zhizhi, it was you.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.860
What did you do?

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.340
Xiaofei. Xiaofei!

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.580
- Xiaofei, wake up.
- Xiaofei!

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.500
Qing, hurry.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.580
Call an ambulance!

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.460
Now!

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.700
Xiaofei.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.860
Xiaofei. Xiaofei.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.500
Get in the car!

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.060
Quick!

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.460
Don't be scared. Mom's here.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:00.980
Be careful.

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.020
Where do you think you're going?

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.500
Stop pretending to be the good one!

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.140
I'm warning you,

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:08.940
stay away from my daughter from now on!

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.280
[Operation Room]

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.300
How is Xiaofei?

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.780
Song Zhizhi,

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.780
I really don't understand

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.660
how you have the nerve to come here.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.980
Why can't you just let her go?

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.740
After you ruined her career here,

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.500
she finally found
an opportunity overseas.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.740
We were planning

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.060
to start over abroad!

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.060
What overseas opportunity?

00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.980
What are you talking about?

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.260
You're still pretending?

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.700
How can you keep pretending?

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:05.900
Keep this up,

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.300
and I'll hit you again

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.620
until you admit it!

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.100
What proof do you have that I did it?

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.540
What proof?

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.540
The proof is that you see Xiaofei
as a thorn in your side!

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.980
Zhizhi,

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.660
all these years,

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.980
I've treated you like my own daughter.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.820
But how have you repaid me?

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.020
How have you treated Xiaofei?

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.260
How... How could you hurt her like this?

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.860
Nie Xiaofei's family?

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:50.860
The skin tissue on her leg
is severely damaged.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.740
According to the CT scan,

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.260
findings include a leg fracture,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.460
nerve rupture,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:56.740
and spinal nerve compression.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.820
She may not be able
to walk normally in the future.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.980
This is our proposed treatment plan.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.980
You need to sign
the surgical consent form.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.780
Okay, alright.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:09.460
Alright.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.260
The last time I signed a consent form

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.860
was for your dad's surgery.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.060
And now, just days later,

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:29.740
I have to sign one for my daughter.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:45.180
Ms. Nie,

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.940
how is Xiaofei now?

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.140
Is she okay?

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.980
She's in surgery.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.100
Song Zhizhi!

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:56.060
Whatever happened between us

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.220
is in the past.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.100
If you can't let go of the past,

00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.100
that's your problem.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.700
Sort out your feelings!

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.580
But now, Nie Xiaofei is my girlfriend.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.980
She's also the sister you live with.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.460
How could you hurt her

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:08.780
so cruelly?

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.660
How can you be so ruthless?

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.540
Let go of me! Let go!
