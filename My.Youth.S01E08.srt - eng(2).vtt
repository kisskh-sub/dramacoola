(My Youth)

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.760
What do you mean?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.010
I guess I needed time to process it, too.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.880
I'm fine with you moving on without me,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.150
but I couldn't stand you thinking my feelings were that shallow.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:20.550
It was just...

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.360
I guess that just makes me a worthless jerk.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.600
For hurting you that day,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.230
I was truly sorry.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.970
I'm sorry.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.460
Gosh!

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.029
I should get this for Je Yeon.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.300
So cute.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:10.370
It looks just like her, doesn't it?

00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:11.770
You have really weird taste.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.040
This one?

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.680
Yes.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.060
I'll buy them for you. Go ahead and get more.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.989
Oh, no, it's fine. I've already got plenty.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.190
Go on, grab one more.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.369
- Hey, I called it... - Here, use this.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.639
I said I was hungry first, so I'm the one who's paying.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.839
Besides, you paid for everything at the stationery shop earlier.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.909
Let me get this.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.210
Please charge it to this card.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.079
When you buy things,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.779
do you make a habit of buying things without checking the price?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.179
I did check the price.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.019
The 2 items at 3.2 dollars...

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.789
and 3 items at 17 dollars,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.390
plus the one you bought because it was cute.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.290
Anyway, you were short-changed by 4.7 dollars.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.529
How on earth did you calculate all that?

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.159
Anyone can do that kind of math in their head, can't they?

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.000
You must be great at math.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.399
Is that why you became a tax accountant?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.570
Math and tax accounting don't have much to do with each other.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.639
I was good at everything. I was just especially good at math.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.269
Then why did you just brag about it?

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.240
I haven't even really started bragging yet.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.110
You're so obnoxious.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.379
Why would someone like that become a tax accountant?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.779
You should've become Pythagoras or something.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.650
I wanted to, back in the day.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.719
"The Kim Seok Joo Theorem."

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.659
What are you theorizing all of a sudden?

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.260
No, the theorem...

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.590
Good grief.

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.830
How do you even know who Pythagoras...

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.500
Never mind. Anyway,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.530
you lost out on some money,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.570
What's the point of going back to fight over it?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.240
That's my regular shop. I'm happy they make a little extra.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.949
So people like you do exist.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.749
And what kind of person is that?

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.880
A good person.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.160
Did you quit your job?

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.159
You've been showing up at all sorts of odd hours.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.060
Who knows? Maybe I will.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.500
Master.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.569
Back when my family went broke my senior year of high school.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.740
Do you remember what you told me when I rejoined the dojang?

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.750
I poured my heart out about being unsure of the path to take.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.390
Of course, I remember.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.860
"I want to practice kendo again, Master."

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.690
You were bawling your eyes out.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.160
Haven't you been reading a few too many sports comics?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.699
You told me that if I just kept going,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.600
everything I've been through would become my path.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.169
Gosh.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.610
I was so cool.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.440
You were always moving around.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.910
So you said this place felt more like home.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.820
Because kendo was the one thing I'd stuck with the longest.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.020
When my family lost everything,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.960
when I had to drop out of school,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.660
Each time, I thought it was the hardest thing I'd ever face.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.730
I wonder what kind of path he's had to walk.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.970
His path always seemed so dark.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.310
I wonder if he felt as hopeless that day.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.550
Mumble all you want,

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.650
I'm not cutting the membership fee any further.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.890
Gosh! Guess that didn't work.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.229
How am I supposed to rebel so that people say I did a good job?

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.029
Gosh, just go away.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.470
- Oh, I'll do it. - No, go warm up!

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.080
I'm really not sorry about this,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.479
but sorry.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.280
Mind if I go first?

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.850
It's just that this is something I've been dying to do.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.419
Besides, I bought you that meal earlier.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.360
So this is why you insisted on treating me.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.290
Go ahead.

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.560
- You ready? - Yes.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.170
- You have to stand perfectly still. - Okay.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.900
Gosh!

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.090
The truth is,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.700
I actually started doing this because of the CEO.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.100
I used to cry a lot on set when I was younger.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.170
One day, she bought me something to supposedly cheer me up.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.979
It turns out she was buying something for her son.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.250
She just gave me the freebies that came with it.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.879
I know that...

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.590
I've lived my acting career as an afterthought.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.290
But I see I've been your afterthought too.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.460
I think you have it backward. I was the add-on.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.200
I cried when no one was looking.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.400
At the hotel back then? You were bawling?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.540
Bawling my eyes out.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.080
What did you want to be, Tae Rin?

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.380
I mean, you weren't born wanting to be an actress, were you?

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.520
Well, that's a secret.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.960
I see.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.020
Is your life ambition to be a secret?

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.460
You know, that doesn't sound half bad.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.600
So is that a yes or a no?

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.900
Nope, it's a secret!

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.410
What?

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:57.780
("Waegeum")

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.370
Hey, Tae Rin. Want to go for a bike ride with me?

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.040
I could even teach you.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.239
But I don't know how.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.279
Let's go diving later instead.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.080
Why the sudden urge to ride a bike?

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:38.980
No reason.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.690
I just wanted to be active for once.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.649
To clear my head.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.859
Tae Rin.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.019
Here, have a cup. I brewed it myself.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.129
Thank you.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.529
Oh, Director.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.559
You know how to ride a bike, don't you?

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560
Could you teach me?

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:55.499
Don't you know I'm swamped with my company launch right now?

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.639
Oh, I'm pretty good. I could teach you.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.870
Gi Ppeum, you're just learning the ropes yourself.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.839
- This is great. It's so delicious. - Good, right?

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.710
Goodbye.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.479
Looking for someone to teach me how to ride a bike.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.519
Thirty-four-year-old adult, total beginner.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.620
Total beginner.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.890
(I am at Chungra Lake Park.)

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.030
What?

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.470
I'm in the area. I can teach you. No payment needed.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.219
Are you KendoChamp?

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.559
By any chance, are you RascalMom?

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.629
Yes.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.200
Gosh, you're really good.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.800
I can help you until I have to leave for Taekwondo.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:03.299
For an hour.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.870
Thank you. I'm counting on you.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.580
Today's my last session before I move.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.980
Oh, but... I was supposed to learn this.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.620
But we're just getting started.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:24.659
"I made such a stupid mistake."

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.959
- Ma'am. - Oh, pop!

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.899
You make me do the strangest things.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.459
And at my age, too.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.729
The puffed rice guy is coming today, but I'm too lazy to go out.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.100
Oh, sure.

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.909
The weather. It's perfect for a trip.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.240
I'd love to go to Jeju Island.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:50.550
No, wait. I'm scared of flying.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420
I mean,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.320
I'm still so terrified of planes flying in the sky.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.620
Isn't it weird? For something so huge?

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.030
Ma'am?

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.459
Yes?

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.800
Is there anything you really want to do before you die?

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.630
Me?

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.170
Surrounded by a vast, open landscape,

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.940
I'm going to drink a delicious cup of coffee that I brewed myself.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.480
Australia would be perfect!

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.310
Australia?

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.749
But I thought you feared planes. That's a long flight to Australia.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.550
I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.590
Maybe I should just follow you to Australia.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.160
Lately, I don't really know who I am.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.860
I just keep overthinking things,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.660
and I'm becoming more hesitant to act.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.900
You know, back when I worked in the school nurse's office,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.039
I really hated how cramped and stuffy it was.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.970
That's why I jumped at the chance to take over this place.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.979
It was great at first. I'd play Korean chess when bored,

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.980
watch people, and look through books.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.050
But now,

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.820
I'm tired of even that.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.419
Is this how my life is going to end?

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.890
I don't want that.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.129
I'm still finding myself at my age,

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.930
so if you had it all figured out, don't you think I'd be jealous?

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.270
Gosh, this is hard.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.210
Why is this so hard?

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.110
You'll get the hang of it soon.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.449
Everything's hard at first.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.580
I don't know.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.350
The world just keeps on moving.

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.860
I'm sorry.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.990
And I'm left wondering what the point of it all is.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.560
I'm...

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.000
sick.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.670
What do you mean you're sick?

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.480
Welco...

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.650
Oh, the firefighter.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.270
Hae's not here this week. I told him to take some time off.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.540
I figured you were here to see him.

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.340
Right.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.410
Did you two have a fight? Because Hae was late the other day?

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.580
That was because he was at the hospital.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.149
He didn't mention anything like that.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.520
What was wrong with him?

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.760
Did you know about this?

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.430
All he told me was...

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.159
that he was sick.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.069
He's never been sick enough to collapse and be rushed to the ER.

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:03.029
So I was really shocked.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.840
You must have been really shocked too, Je Yeon.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.570
What's the illness?

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:11.910
Is he dying?

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.180
Oh, well, that's...

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.549
I think it would be best if you heard it from Hae directly.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.150
It's not my place to say.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.590
Oh, but you must have been so upset.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.059
Nu Ri.

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.729
About last weekend, when you stayed at Min Kyung's...

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.599
I said I studied all weekend.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.670
I wasn't just playing around.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.740
Min Kyung is ranked 99th, you know.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.240
Don't you miss your mom?

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.280
No, I don't.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.780
Oh, don't say that.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.760
I can't believe people.

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.259
Just throwing their trash all over.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.599
They should fine everyone who does that.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.970
Right in front of someone's house...

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.490
I've been thinking.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.600
This isn't how we should end things.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.200
It's just like last time.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.600
You have your reasons for pushing me away,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.310
and I get mad at you for it.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.110
And sometimes,

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.850
I've regretted those moments.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.480
I've been doing some thinking too.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.980
Why isn't he here yet?

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.649
Oh, hey.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:04.660
Hello.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.319
Are you here to see him?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.929
Yes, I have something to talk to him about.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.829
Go on in and talk. Make yourself comfortable.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.330
I'll make you some coffee.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.500
You can head inside.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.870
Should we go somewhere else?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.550
You didn't have to buy this.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.120
That day...

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.260
That day, I...

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.400
I feel like I just sprung it on you.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.170
I thought there was nothing left to be afraid of,

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.410
but after I told you,

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.980
I got scared all over again.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.780
I can't lie or sugarcoat it.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.490
And you're crying and worrying sick.

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.590
I realized that's how it's going to be.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.890
That's what scared me.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.200
It doesn't even feel real to me yet.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.900
So how could I have explained it to you?

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.750
Where does it hurt?

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.950
Is it okay if I ask what it is?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.160
If it's so serious that you'd say we shouldn't see each other...

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.860
- Is it... - Fatal?

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.700
Yes.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.940
If you're unlucky.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.750
And I was unlucky.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.220
And that luck...

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.790
Can't it get better?

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:19.790
Is there nothing that can be done?

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.260
They say meds can slow it down.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.530
For the record, it's not like I'm in agonizing pain or anything.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.870
So make sure you don't skip your health checkups, either.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.770
Get regular blood work done, too.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.240
The prognosis for most diseases is good if you catch them early.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.509
How can you be joking right now?

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:42.150
I'm not joking.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.620
You explained everything so earnestly,

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.390
and I'm just supposed to accept it?

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:55.660
The reasons we can't be together?

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:00.330
Thank you for coming to see me.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.910
Sure.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.050
I'll get going.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.790
This time, I mean it.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.290
Don't follow me.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:53.750
I saw Tae Rin and Sunwoo Hae's show got a good response.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.020
Their image isn't bad at all.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.489
How about we use them for marketing?

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.090
Let's announce the greenlight sooner for "World Made of Ash 3."

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.860
"The author of the novel behind the successful film is Sunwoo Hae."

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.870
Je Yeon...

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.000
Jae Won, what do you think?

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.810
Well...

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.179
Before the finale of the docuseries airs,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.939
we need to release it as an exclusive.

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.810
With no regard for his feelings whatsoever?

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.509
Can we really dredge all this up just to promote a movie?

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.720
People are already interested. That's a risk he'll have to take.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.919
As part of the recent restructuring,

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.260
we've established the new Management Consulting Division.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.390
He's Kim Seok Joo, the incoming head of that division.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.929
Some of you may have seen him around.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.230
He's been learning the ropes.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:41.260
As some of you may already know,

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:43.100
he's my son.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.650
What was that?

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.450
So my opinion just doesn't matter?

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.379
How could you just spring this on me like this?

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.720
Can we please do this later?

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:03.820
No. Make it quick.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.189
I want a career with my degree I worked so hard for.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:09.689
Is that such a problem for you?

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.759
I like my current company, and...

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.799
You're proud of working at such a second-rate company?

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800
You should be ashamed of yourself.

00:23:14.801 --> 00:23:16.399
Don't you dare badmouth my company.

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.469
You might be at the top of your industry,

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.299
but that only flies in your industry, Mom.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.269
Then why did you bother coming in to learn the work?

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:23.839
Because I was worried about you, Mom.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.839
I was just stopping by to see how you were.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.840
We're not...

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.279
a family that lovingly checks in or has meals together.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.480
That's just not who we are.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.149
Come on, what's so hard about asking how someone is?

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.849
You just ask.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.989
Mom.

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.819
I have done everything you ever told me to.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.059
You told me to be number one, so I was.

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.529
You told me to study abroad, so I went.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.830
In all that time,

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:46.030
did you ever once ask me if I was okay?

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.370
That whole "checking in on someone" thing?

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.430
So how am I supposed to ask how you're doing?

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.240
I never learned how to do things like that.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.370
Exactly.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.280
Just like that.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.110
You were doing a great job just now.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.180
The company needs someone who can stand up to me.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.990
I can't get through to you at all, can I?

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.820
I won't wait long.

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.660
Put in your notice at your company.

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.340
Gi Ppeum, what on earth is your problem?

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.809
You got into a university that's nearly impossible to get into,

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.910
but you can't even get a driver's license?

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.180
I failed the road test again.

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:43.390
The script.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.020
What did you think?

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:47.590
If it's something I absolutely have to do,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.089
then I suppose I'll give it a try.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.500
You brought it to me, and I trust your judgment.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.170
I want to hear what you really think.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.900
You always dig deep.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.340
Then...

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.980
can I think it over a bit more and get back to you?

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240
Sure.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:10.280
Gi Ppeum, what was your take on it?

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.179
The righteous detective, Kongjwi,

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.019
launching a targeted investigation against Patjwi.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.849
To me, that reveals the limitations of the South Korean police.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.659
- What? - Having so many psychopaths...

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.259
in South Korea is, in itself, a statistical error.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.400
My conclusion is that Patjwi is just an ordinary horticulturist.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.670
I've been born again!

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.369
Forget the detective.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.379
How was the villain's part?

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.439
Pinpointing Patjwi as the culprit...

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.109
is just a symptom of the ills of Korean society.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.549
Gi Ppeum!

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.049
Okay, we get it. You're highly educated.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:49.490
I asked you to review a script, not critique Korean society.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.219
Well...

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.659
Does anyone know how to go astray?

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.059
Want to go free-diving?

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.399
Come with me, into the water.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.669
I don't think that's quite it.

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:04.199
If you're going to chit-chat, get out.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.570
Am I the only one in this meeting?

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.310
I came because I was lonely.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.710
Please be nice to me.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.940
If you're going to chit-chat, get out.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.610
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.919
About that Kongjwi role. Kwon Do Eun is reviewing it.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.489
I hear it's pretty much a done deal.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:28.159
Her schedule is booked next year, so shooting will start soon.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.730
And it's scheduled to air in the first half of next year.

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.930
It was the first script Tae Rin read since switching agencies,

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.970
so I did a little digging back then.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.300
You were so cool just now.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:41.809
You're a real pro.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.510
And here I thought you only came to cause trouble.

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.380
What?

00:26:47.381 --> 00:26:48.979
Since you're here, want to see a new script?

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.980
Deal.

00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:52.080
But you're treating me to something good.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.880
- Something really good. - Thank you.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.319
I'm so hungry, everything tastes amazing.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.930
Gosh, why have you been skipping meals?

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.900
Word on the street is Nam Jun Ho is signing with you guys.

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.469
Shouldn't you be swamped?

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:11.569
But I see you still, well...

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.040
You don't even have chairs yet.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.910
When are they coming? Did you get them custom-made?

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:18.209
If you're not busy,

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.709
could you rent a truck to get the chairs from my parents' place?

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:21.710
What?

00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:23.379
You can rent a truck?

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.720
I thought they had to come with a driver.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.579
Should I call someone?

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.149
I know a guy with a delivery truck.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.950
What, who's this guy now?

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.030
Hey, are you busy?

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:40.060
Yes, I need you to grab your truck and go pick up some chairs.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.229
He wants to know what you're paying.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.640
- Tell him I'll pay him well. - Hey, she says she'll pay you well.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:47.670
Should I go too?

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.770
Okay.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.010
He's on board.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.280
A new flame?

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080
Hey!

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.519
You can't get into a scandal right after switching agencies.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.249
A company that doesn't even have chairs...

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.560
isn't equipped to handle one.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.300
Hold on a second.

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:17.899
Yes? What's up?

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:19.869
Je Yeon, did you see the article about Bebop?

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.299
No. What article?

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:22.769
What else could possibly be out there?

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:24.309
Oh, my heart...

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.609
I mean...

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.140
We're trending at number one.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:29.480
I guess it's thanks to Bebop.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:33.350
After the news that Bebop is the creator of "World Made of Ash,"

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.620
Our on-demand viewership has skyrocketed.

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:39.090
I see.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.720
Oh, what a relief.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:45.660
You scared me. I thought it was an article on Hae.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.469
I'm sorry. My bad.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:49.600
You doing okay?

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.139
I'm good. How about you?

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:55.169
I've been busy planning my wedding.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.409
I'll send you an invitation soon.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.840
Take care of yourself.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.180
What?

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.350
What's wrong? Are your eyes stinging?

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.290
Yes, they are.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:13.360
They're stinging.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.530
(Palgakdo)

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.510
(Bebop)

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:05.139
- What now? - Oh, hey.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.279
I owe you 50 dollars for the ride. Where can I send it?

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.110
Oh, right. I almost got stiffed.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:12.679
I'll text you my account number.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.620
Okay, text it to me.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.019
So, how have you been? Doing good?

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:18.719
Just wire me the money. I'm hanging up.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.390
No, wait a second.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.459
Is everything okay with you?

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:25.159
Are you just bored again?

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.399
No.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.329
Did you, I don't know, hurt someone who came on too strong recently?

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.000
Does that ring any bells?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.140
I'm hanging up.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.110
Something's definitely up.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.259
What? What's wrong?

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.000
You're so adorable.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.370
And someone made my girl cry?

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:05.030
Who made you cry?

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.199
It's nothing.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.770
I just got something in my eye.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.250
No, really. Nothing's wrong.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.480
It's just that...

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.820
I think I might go home for a little while.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.760
Wednesday. A clear day.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.399
The opening of Start of Spring.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.599
Seok Joo, turn on the lights!

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.299
My favorite people are here.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.370
There we go.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.439
So, what's Start of Spring?

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.609
Oh, it means you're ugly.

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.610
Hey! You...

00:32:19.611 --> 00:32:22.850
I got to make Nu Ri's graduation bouquet myself.

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.209
You guys are the ugly ones.

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.449
- No way. - Oh, hello, ma'am.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:28.650
Hello.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.989
Start of Spring. It's a nice name.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.159
On Teacher's Day, I'll get you an armful of carnations.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.859
Wishing you great fortune!

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.200
This one's mine! Yes! Thank you.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.299
- Hey, the rice cakes are here! - Oh, you're here?

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.570
These rice cakes are so good.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:44.870
Oh, ma'am.

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.639
Start of Spring.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.509
"Late Autumn" is still a better name than "Start of Spring."

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:50.510
My shop's name is way better.

00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.309
All the flowers that I can't sell are for Geon No.

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:55.079
To celebrate, how about a planter?

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.409
Look at you, not even thinking of paying.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:57.649
Hurry inside and hand out the rice cakes.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.849
I guess I'll have to keep caring for the plant Seok Joo took.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:01.949
If I want it to grow well.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:03.549
- Good, right? - It's delicious.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.790
I'll go hand the rest out.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:07.490
Hello.

00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:08.890
We just opened today, so we brought some...

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.660
We went to the neighboring shops, handing out rice cakes.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.099
Then we all ordered jjajangmyeon together.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.570
- We hope to be good neighbors. - Of course.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.550
There was one other face that came to mind.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.919
(Congratulations on Opening)

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.050
You...

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.120
If you saw me now,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.820
what would you say?

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.750
(Friday, cloudy)

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.760
Idiot.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.409
Why is your bag so big?

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:33.639
Can I see how heavy it is?

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.280
This bag? Is it that big?

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:37.080
Je Yeon!

00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:41.179
Oh my gosh, you didn't even call. What brings you here?

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.890
I was craving your cooking.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:49.589
Oh, I'm exhausted already.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.730
Oh, dear.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.030
Oh, right.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:55.930
Oh, perfect timing.

00:34:55.931 --> 00:34:58.269
I have to run to the bank,

00:34:58.270 --> 00:34:59.839
so you help the kids with their schoolwork.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.969
Kids, be good and listen to your teacher.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.340
- What? - Okay!

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.449
All right, I'm your teacher for the day. Sit down!

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:15.620
(Sunwoo Hae Revealed to Be Author of "World Made of Ash")

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.860
Hae wrote a book?

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.429
("World Made of Ash" is out of print.)

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.760
And it's out of print?

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:27.329
Sir.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.569
There's an issue with the cover for Author Hwang's new book.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.170
He must have inherited my talent.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.739
Let's have our company do a rerelease. Yes.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.109
So...

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.010
How... Oh, hold on.

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.480
Hey, son! It's, Dad. Yes.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:49.549
Hey, about "World Made of Ash..." I hear you're the author.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.850
I saw an article about it.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.989
- What do you want? - Well...

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.199
Let's republish it, the one that went out of print.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.659
Dad will help you out.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.699
My staff is really good at what they do.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.639
Wait, how did you get my number?

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.000
Nu Ri gave it to...

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.040
No, wait, that's not right.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.880
Someone gave it to me.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.340
Where are you right now?

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.410
I said, where are you?

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.410
Spit it out.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:19.980
I asked what your business here is.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.179
I said I'm here to see the CEO. Now, where is he?

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:24.620
Our CEO is out right now. What's this about?

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.430
I really didn't want to have to say this,

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.360
but I'm the CEO's son.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:35.800
His biological son.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:42.139
Did you just tell them you're my son?

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.740
Why are you there?

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:44.940
He's my son.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.740
Are you trying to make a scene...

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.280
in front of all the employees?

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.680
Come on, let's take this show inside.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.290
I'm very sorry.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120
This way.

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.530
Sorry, it's a little messy in here.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.730
I wasn't expecting you.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.170
Explain yourself.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:12.940
Why are you in contact with Nu Ri?

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600
Well...

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.939
Hae, listen. Just calm down for a second.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.139
Why don't you come over here?

00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.380
Let's sit down and try to talk about this calmly.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:24.010
So all this time,

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.819
you were meeting Nu Ri's birth mother...

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:28.050
and never said a single word?

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.290
No, it's just...

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.560
How did you find out?

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.929
Nu Ri's birth mom saw the show and came to find me.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.390
Wait, why would she go to you?

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:41.260
Look.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.199
I met with Nu Ri's mom a few times about some paperwork.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.400
But that's all it was.

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:50.139
Back when you were in the army,

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.540
Seok Joo brought Nu Ri over to stay with me for a while.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.750
My heart just went out to her.

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.609
But there was nothing more to it.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:01.419
I'd just buy Nu Ri a meal from time to time,

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.290
give her some allowance,

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.550
and I'd ask Nu Ri...

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.859
how her mom was doing.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.860
So...

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.599
You and Eun Nu Ri conspired to lie to me for at least ten years?

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.960
I only started seeing her again recently. I promise.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.299
Nu Ri said she found something she wanted to do,

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.999
so I was just so proud of her.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.670
And you knew about Eun Nu Ri's photography too?

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:24.670
Her photos are amazing, aren't they?

00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:27.680
Gosh, my kids just...

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.480
They must all have a knack for the arts.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.149
You've completely lost it, haven't you?

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.349
You raised Nu Ri so well that...

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.120
her talent was able to blossom.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:38.690
Do you know why...

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.660
I took Nu Ri in?

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.300
Because I didn't want to be like you.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:51.000
You came to me to abandon her, and I refused to do the same.

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.800
I could barely even feed myself. You think I wanted to take her in?

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:57.570
In...

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:59.410
my whole life, there's...

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.380
one thing I could never forgive.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:03.880
What will you do about Nu Ri?

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.949
For now, I was thinking of an orphanage...

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:06.950
Are you crazy?

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.690
I guess you didn't mention that part to Nu Ri.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.460
Did Nu Ri not mention this?

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.760
I'm...

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:24.500
I'm going to die.

00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:35.710
I should have just died with Mom back then.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.120
Or better yet, should I just die for you right now?

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.080
You little punk.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.420
Sunwoo Hae!

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:47.590
No matter how angry you get, you can't just say things like that.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:51.989
Especially since you wrote stuff under your mom's name.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:53.300
How could you say something like that?

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.670
When everything happened with Mom, where were you?

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.880
You were nowhere to be found when I needed you.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.550
All I did was wait.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.350
Completely in the dark.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.159
Waiting and waiting.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.090
And waiting and waiting!

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.790
I don't know what I ever saw in you.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.400
Why did you abandon me?

00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:39.480
Tell me.

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.010
Why did you leave me behind?

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:47.780
Dad.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.990
Was I such a burden?

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:56.490
No, that's not it.

00:40:57.730 --> 00:40:58.730
Back then,

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.300
I was just a failure.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.000
I was too immature.

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.500
I'm so sorry.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:13.340
Gosh, we're the only family we have.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.510
It wasn't like that.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.380
I wish...

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.780
I wish I had inherited that irresponsibility.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.690
Then I could have lived doing whatever I wanted.

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.260
After all this time, why now?

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:17.310
Mom.

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:18.610
Yes?

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:20.510
What's this?

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.149
I saw one in the study room too.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.209
Oh, that. At the study room...

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.980
Your aunt said it helps develop the kids' creativity.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.420
Can I try this, too?

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.460
I could use a little...

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:36.590
creativity myself.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.030
Should we make some kimchi fried rice?

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.899
You said you loved the kimchi I brought from Min Kyung's place.

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:47.970
That it was so refreshing.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.810
Eun Nu Ri.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:52.840
Your birth mother came looking for you.

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:55.740
You should meet her.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:57.850
And tell her you want to live with her.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.720
What? No, I can...

00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.220
I can barely even remember her face right now.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:08.789
But why would she want me?

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:10.330
That's why you need to meet her and talk it out.

00:43:10.530 --> 00:43:11.790
What's with your attitude?

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.599
What's gotten into you?

00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.299
You're acting like you were just stuck raising me.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.000
- Because I was. - Hey!

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.300
Don't scream. This is a public place.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.300
Is that how I raised you?

00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:26.580
What's gotten into you?

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.280
Do the grocery shopping by yourself!

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.629
Hey, there are plenty of seats here!

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.399
Come on, over here!

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.570
Oh, sorry.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:56.940
Hey!

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.509
Hey, you punk!

00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:59.879
You little punk.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.949
You skipped the baseball game, you punk.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.350
We got totally creamed today because of you.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.950
- What? - You little punk.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:08.849
Who are you?

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.219
This guy's wasted.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.860
It's me, Won Seok, you punk!

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.130
Can I get a beer, please?

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.290
- Okay. - No.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.399
A beer, please!

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.060
No, I'm not drunk.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.130
And I don't know anyone named Won Seok.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:26.340
Me?

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.540
Oh, right. I have the wrong person.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.940
- Gosh, I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. Don't worry.

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:37.880
Since fate brought us together, how about we share a beer?

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.520
This neighborhood's changed so much.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.290
All the good spots are gone.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.429
It's become a tourist trap.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:55.930
I don't have a dog. I'm raising a little sister, though.

00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.800
She's not much to look at.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.039
And she never listens to a single thing I say.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.410
We got completely destroyed by the other team today.

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.440
And she's sneaking around with him behind my back.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.820
Anyway, he's always the one causing problems.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.120
No, Won Seok.

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:16.819
I'm the problem.

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.119
This dried pollock is actually pretty good with the sauce.

00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.120
What's the problem?

00:45:20.121 --> 00:45:23.090
Why did it have to be me?

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.360
Why did it have to be now?

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:28.999
Maybe I could just die today.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.600
No way! You can't die! You're drinking with me tonight!

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:34.270
You only live once. Why waste it like this?

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.609
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:37.810
Goodness.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:44.810
Well...

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.220
What about you, Won Seok?

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.420
How do you live your life?

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:50.690
Me?

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:53.420
For me, once I swing the bat,

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.860
I just run, no matter what.

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.530
Whether it's an out or a home run.

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.060
Go!

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.729
All right. To the only life we've got.

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.270
- Cheers! - Cheers!

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.370
Actually, this is my second life.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.150
I mean...

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:25.550
I don't know why I made such a fuss about not drinking all my life.

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.220
Won Seok.

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.130
When I was younger,

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:32.730
I didn't drink because it felt like a waste of money.

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:37.199
And when I grew up, I couldn't drink for health reasons.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:41.670
No, that was smart. Health is the most important thing.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.340
"Whatever. Let's just drink till we drop."

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.880
I couldn't even work up the nerve for that.

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.279
No, that's the wrong kind of courage to have.

00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.150
Drinking is one thing,

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:54.479
but you need a different kind of courage.

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.620
The truth is,

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.350
I want to get down on my knees...

00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.620
and just beg.

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.760
And ask them to love me.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.260
And not to leave me.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.070
But...

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.970
I'd rather die than do that.

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.040
That would be so selfish of me.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.650
Gosh, that hurts.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.419
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:30.349
- Come on, have a drink with us! - Gosh.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:32.250
We've been looking all over for you.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.260
Hey, wait. Aren't you Gi Yong?

00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:39.230
See? I told you. I'm not the only one, right?

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:40.659
He looks just like him, right?

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:44.599
Hey! Without you, our team's been terrible lately!

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.670
Oh, boy.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.440
Hello there.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:49.500
My name is Sunwoo Hae. I was just...

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.470
Won Seok and I...

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.210
just happened to end up sharing a table.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.679
We're here because we lost our baseball game today.

00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.879
- Oh, that's too bad. - Goodness.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.249
- It's all right. - Hey, come on, get up.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.949
- Our driver's here. - Okay, let's go.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.489
- You should go. Your jacket... - It's fine, don't worry about it.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.390
You wear it. It's fine. It's a gift from me. Seriously.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.690
Well then, here's my card.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.459
Here, you too.

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:16.699
- Please give me a call. - I will.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.670
- Come on, hurry up! - Let's go, hurry!

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.240
Hey.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:23.640
Life's not easy, is it?

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:25.940
Hang in there!

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:27.510
Gosh.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.880
Don't try to control everything.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:31.510
You know?

00:48:32.010 --> 00:48:34.080
All right, if you ever want to play baseball, give me a call.

00:48:34.850 --> 00:48:35.850
I'm heading out.

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.720
- Take care, Won Seok! - Right, see you.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.600
(Start of Spring)

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.340
So what's Seok Joo up to these days?

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.209
You should ask Seok Joo to set you up...

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.379
with a tax accountant colleague.

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:05.880
Stop moping at home all day.

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.289
Oh, that Seok Joo. Ever since he was a kid,

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:13.119
he's been so handsome and well-mannered.

00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.759
- Right? - What's going on?

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.860
Je Yeon's boyfriend?

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.889
- The tax accountant? - No, just a guy friend.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.130
Oh, seriously.

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.530
This is so humiliating.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.440
What? Did you actually call him?

00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.539
Seok Joo. Our dearest Seok Joo.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:34.380
Seok Joo, the tax accountant.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.209
Are you with your mom or something?

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:38.110
Seok Joo, how have you been?

00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:41.479
Oh, come on now.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.420
Can't you do something about Je Yeon?

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:49.890
She's too good for me, ma'am.

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:51.960
Okay, bye now.

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:53.929
For goodness' sake.

00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:56.569
Hey, it's Sung Je Yeon! That's her!

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:58.169
Yes, that's Sung Je Yeon.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:01.439
- Hey, give Sung Je Yeon a call. - Why did you drink?

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.740
You would never drink with me, even if the world were ending.

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.180
Whatever.

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:09.510
What did she say?

00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:11.610
This is just...

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:14.379
a huge pain for someone who has to work tomorrow.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.949
Unbelievable.

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.590
I'm upset too. We should've had a drink together.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.319
Why are you drinking alone? You should've called me first.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.660
How come only you get to do this?

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.359
I want in.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.129
What on earth is wrong with you?

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.930
Why? Am I not allowed to act like this?

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.029
You're driving me crazy.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.140
So I'm...

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.500
not allowed to do anything?

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.210
Or be anything?

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:55.990
Here's the plum syrup I made the other day.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.329
Drink it or don't. I don't care.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:50:59.960
Drink it and get a stomachache for all I care.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:08.469
I've been saving this. Use it for your living expenses.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:11.470
I'll be 20 soon, so I'll get a job and help out.

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.879
The flower shop went under, didn't it?

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:18.209
I've never seen you act like this in my entire life.

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:19.610
Because the shop failed, Mom...

00:51:21.550 --> 00:51:23.150
You're telling me to go live with Mom, aren't you?

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.150
Where did you get this money?

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.020
I really don't get it.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.430
How could you send me to someone whose face I can't even remember?

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:34.499
Aren't you hurt by this?

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.329
We're family. You're the only family I have.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.099
What do you mean I'm the only family you have?

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.499
I heard you've been keeping in touch with that guy.

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:41.600
That guy...

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.570
You mean Mr. Chan?

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:45.910
You knew all along?

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.840
You were lying to me?

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.179
How could you do that to your own family?

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.380
To my family?

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.580
You know what makes a family a family?

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.950
It means eating together.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:57.420
Living together.

00:51:57.790 --> 00:52:00.689
It means not sulking like you and talking everything out.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:02.119
That's the point.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.260
Lately, I feel like we're more of a family than ever.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.429
Then why is everyone so desperate to get rid of me?

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:08.500
If you were going to be like this,

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:11.830
you should've left me at the park! Why did you even come for me?

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:23.410
You're the one who left me.

00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:35.759
Stop fiddling with that.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.090
You're going to wear it out.

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:41.860
Are you trying to torture it?

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:43.600
What is it you want?

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.670
How long do penguins live?

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:48.470
Well, up to 50 years?

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.410
You should've been born a penguin.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:56.610
Get up, you rascal.

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:58.780
Let's go.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:02.280
I'm so tired.

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:05.389
- Get up. - Gosh!

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.450
I...

00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:09.520
I can beat Tae Rin,

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.689
but I'm no match for you.

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.959
Oh, really?

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.429
They say a parent is no match for their child.

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:17.469
Well then, I'll take my win where I can get it.

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:19.629
Oh, so that's how you're going to be?

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:20.640
Careful.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.839
All right, fine. I was wrong.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.510
I'll just be quiet and walk.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.779
Great view, fresh air.

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.320
All this needs now is a cup of coffee.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.850
You're having some without me?

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.090
- Give me some. - You want some?

00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:42.720
- Good thing I brought this, right? - Yes.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:48.129
Gosh, that's an eye-opener!

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.559
You have to keep moving.

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:51.669
It's important to stabilize your amygdala, you know?

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:53.669
You know, when people just sit around,

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:56.340
they just get stuck in their own head. And what happens then?

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.809
Oh, gosh.

00:53:59.810 --> 00:54:03.309
I forgot I was with my tutor, the esteemed Ms. Kim Su Jin.

00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:05.579
I just got some serious trauma flashbacks.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.950
And you used to do that all the time without knowing the consequences?

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.450
Think about your past, okay? Did that get you anywhere?

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.590
That's why, just like we're doing now...

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:18.560
Look.

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.599
Let's just focus on what's ahead.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600
Okay?

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:25.630
- Okay! - I'm off!

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.240
Let's go.

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:46.020
Hey there, Ms. Kim Su Jin.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:51.630
I've been so busy making money, I've been a bit out of touch.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:59.430
What if I came back down here and started teaching again?

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:01.900
I'd have kids lining up out the door for my class.

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.810
You think?

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.710
You think teaching kids is that easy?

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.110
You're the one who quit teaching after a few weeks. Please.

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.649
Ms. Kim Su Jin.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.819
You know, I saw a place over there earlier.

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.149
Isn't there a place where you can post your wishes or something?

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:20.589
Hey, Sung Je Yeon.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:22.459
I brought you here to clear your mind,

00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:24.359
not fill it with more desires.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.360
Gosh, that hurts.

00:55:25.361 --> 00:55:27.229
You don't love me, do you?

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.899
You don't even know what love...

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.270
Right, of course, you don't.

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.169
Hey, this right here between us is what love is.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:34.600
It's not that big a deal.

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.310
You have my utmost respect.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.950
Is that how you're strong enough to put up with Dad?

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:48.179
Your dad's not that mentally tough, is he?

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:51.090
So what if his business failed? It happens.

00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:55.160
You know the saying, life is like throwing an egg against a rock.

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:59.460
You just have to be the rock. Always, you hear?

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.329
Then the world is the egg.

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:02.430
Mom.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:06.130
Never mind.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:08.970
I think I've come up against a pretty giant egg.

00:56:09.170 --> 00:56:10.710
You're hiding something.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:13.439
It's Seok Joo, isn't it?

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.609
The "Seok" in his name means stone, doesn't it?

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:16.809
You can't break him.

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.479
- This time, you're the egg. - No, Mom, it's not like that.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.120
I'm telling you, it's not.

00:56:23.850 --> 00:56:25.390
Oh, seriously.

00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.559
You're getting me all worked up, and now it hurts.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.559
- Gosh! - Why do you always try to run away?

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.660
It's okay.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.660
Let's go.

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:41.200
- Mom. - Yes?

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.670
I love you.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:46.980
What was that?

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.480
I can't quite hear you, Princess.

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:51.410
Whatever. I'm hungry.

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:54.650
Let's go down, okay?

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.830
We should probably head back up.

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:08.400
(Start of Spring)

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:40.930
Hey, Yong Dal.

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:43.000
I thought Mo Tae Rin was coming.

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:03.380
Aren't we heading out, Yong Dal?

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.300
So I've been thinking.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.110
About our pay for today...

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:26.410
I didn't confirm if it was per person.

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.079
What did the Director say?

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:32.549
She said she'd give us a little more than the truck rental fee.

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:34.280
We should get paid for the delivery, too.

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:40.990
Excuse me, ma'am?

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.159
The pay for today is per person, right?

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.530
And the delivery fee is separate.

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:47.260
Right.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:50.099
- This is the last of it, right? - Yes.

00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:52.530
- Oh, my, be careful. - Yes, we're all done.

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:55.199
Oh, honestly.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.799
I mean, that girl, Han Na...

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.310
Still so scatterbrained at 40. My goodness.

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.980
You must be so proud of how well the director is doing.

00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:07.780
I remember scraping together my savings to send her to Seoul.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.189
Well, even though she's a handful, please take good care of her.

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:12.389
We will.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:13.719
Oh, and here.

00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.959
Oh, what's this?

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.560
Just something to snack on for the ride.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.260
- Gosh, thank you so much. - Oh, it's nothing.

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:24.969
It was great for us too. We got a nice trip, thanks to her.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:27.900
Oh, my, I've been talking too much. I've held you up.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.069
Well, drive safe on your way back up.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:31.339
- We will. - Okay.

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.270
- Take care. - Thank you.

00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.420
What's wrong?

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.679
My stomach's been feeling off lately.

00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.019
It's just...

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:46.049
Hey, let's stop and get some digestive medicine.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:47.120
Gosh.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.860
It must be from sitting in the truck for so long.

00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:52.729
Want to rest a bit before we head out?

00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:53.730
Yes.

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:57.100
My ears have been burning all day.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:02.100
Okay, so there are two things to discuss.

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.910
I booked you a photo shoot.

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.409
I'm going to ask for the interview questions in advance.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:09.739
She doesn't usually give them out, but she and I are close.

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:12.179
Looks like I'll have to lose some weight.

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:13.379
And the other thing?

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.120
About that drama, "Kongjwi and Patjwi."

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.749
Apparently, it's fully cast.

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.520
I'm so sorry. I know you read it carefully.

01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:24.890
It's always a race against time, isn't it?

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:28.960
Why do I feel so relieved?

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:34.770
To be honest, something about it was bothering me anyway.

01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:37.739
It read more like a romance than a thriller to me.

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:39.940
I found the writer's intent hard to grasp.

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:44.350
You thought it read like a romance?

01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:47.580
If you read it that way, it has a completely different vibe.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.219
That could be interesting.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.750
Well, my interpretation was probably wrong.

01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.719
Maybe I overthought it.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.660
Why do I have to read so much into everything?

01:00:58.890 --> 01:00:59.960
Director.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.560
You don't have your hopes too high, do you?

01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:04.429
You know my limits.

01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:06.800
My hopes are just your size.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.940
What?

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.240
What do you mean by that?

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.640
How about a salad for lunch?

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.509
Didn't you say you needed to slim down?

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:20.679
These roads are so confusing.

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.280
Director!

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.990
(Bicycle Rental)

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:34.030
Gosh, you didn't have to come.

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:36.230
Why did you push yourself to come here?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.070
- Thanks. - Drink it.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.099
What if you had passed out while driving?

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.440
You're not the only one who could get hurt, you know.

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.670
It was for the greater good.

01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.840
Right.

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:55.120
You're in no condition to leave yet.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.190
It's time you paid me back.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.320
For what?

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.630
You said you'd teach me how to ride a bike.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960
Right now?

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.760
This seat is too high.

01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:12.799
No, if it's this low, my feet will drag.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.500
That way, your feet can catch you before you fall.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:17.710
There.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.910
Fine, you know best.

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:23.339
Okay, I'll give it a try.

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.010
Okay, be careful.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.980
Here I go.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.990
Gosh. I'm doing it!

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:37.330
- Gosh. - Hey!

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.530
I wasn't trying to hug you.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:45.770
I know. Just be careful.

01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.240
Hey, come on!

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:52.210
Give me some tips.

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:54.779
And stop making me crash into you.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.880
Tips?

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:59.310
You know, balancing.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.349
Not being scared, not getting hurt.

01:03:01.350 --> 01:03:04.750
Gosh. You call those tips?

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.190
Don't imagine things.

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:13.160
Fear comes from your imagination.

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.670
Don't picture yourself falling. Just look straight ahead and go.

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:22.970
Can you really do that?

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.109
Yes. That's why I can ride.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.580
But you can't.

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:33.650
If this happens again,

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.120
no matter what,

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.150
the end will be like this.

01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.950
Let's stop seeing each other.

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:48.260
Show me again. I'm going to nail it this time.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.630
I'll show you how it's done. Watch how I ride.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:58.510
Don't be afraid.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:01.180
Just like this. Look ahead. Don't look down.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:44.650
Ready to try again?

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.590
Yes.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.030
Are you okay?

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:54.199
- Careful. - Yes.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.559
- I'm letting go. - Okay.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.700
- I'm letting go. - Wait.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:02.700
Wait, am I doing it?

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:06.370
Yes, I got it! See?

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:18.550
See?

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.320
Yes.

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:39.640
I missed you.

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.480
I've been thinking about it a lot,

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:50.550
and I keep coming to the same conclusion.

01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:57.830
If I...

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:00.090
say I want to keep seeing you,

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.530
- then what? - Je Yeon.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.270
Please...

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:12.769
Please, don't.

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:14.680
I can't stop thinking about you.

01:06:15.810 --> 01:06:17.109
I don't know why.

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:19.410
Is it because I hate you or because I feel bad for you?

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.820
That's why I came.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.820
But now that I see your face, I get it.

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:29.760
I can't get over my feelings.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.730
I can't end things like this.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.030
It's already over.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.530
I don't want to be a burden to you.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.110
Even if we start something, I can't see it through to the end.

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:51.310
I'll make you lonely and cry again over things I can't even promise.

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.220
There's no guarantee that won't happen.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520
I...

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:06.359
want to make the person I like smile.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.630
Not make them cry.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.970
I hate you putting up with things because of me.

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.139
I hate that you wouldn't be able to be yourself.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.140
So...

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.970
don't waste yourself on me.

01:07:21.310 --> 01:07:23.610
Even I don't know what's going to happen to me.

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:26.910
Asking you to endure that with me isn't the right thing to do.

01:07:27.150 --> 01:07:29.519
You said life is like a gamble.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.089
That some days you win big, and other days you lose it all.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.560
Then why do you always...

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.560
bet on losing?

01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:40.289
Can't you just give in for once and try?

01:07:40.290 --> 01:07:42.100
I shouldn't have said that to you.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:44.900
I shouldn't have...

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.810
I never should have told you that.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:52.910
Told me what?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.280
That you're sick?

01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:58.450
You're just...

01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:01.450
a coward.

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:03.850
You just...

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:06.390
don't like me enough.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.220
It's just...

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:12.860
That's all it is.

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:18.100
I'm so sick of this.

01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:37.050
Hey, Sung Je Yeon!

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.090
Wait.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.619
- Let go. - Wait.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.229
- I said let go! - Your shoelace is untied.

01:08:44.230 --> 01:08:45.960
- Let go! - Just a second!

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.800
It'll just take a second.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100
Just a moment.

01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:18.060
I've been asking you one thing this whole time.

01:09:21.260 --> 01:09:22.930
Do you like me or not?

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:43.280
I don't.

01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:47.720
Happy?

01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:59.189
- She must be really hurt. - Oh, my gosh, I was so shocked...

01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:00.659
It was so shocking, wasn't it?

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:04.259
- Did you see her? She collapsed. - I know, right? Goodness.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:07.430
I wonder if she went to a hospital.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.569
Her knees were scraped up. Seriously...

01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.839
That was so scary, wasn't it? Gosh. What a mess.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.540
Excuse me.

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:17.879
Did something happen here?

01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.149
Oh, my goodness. Earlier, a woman on a bicycle...

01:11:21.150 --> 01:11:23.919
and a group of skateboarders crashed right into each other.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.789
They just took her away in an ambulance.

01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:28.889
You must be with her. Oh, you poor thing.

01:11:28.890 --> 01:11:32.729
She went down so hard that she couldn't get up at all.

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:35.760
- You must be with her. - You should hurry and go, okay?

01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.510
(Phone)

01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:52.610
The person you have called...

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:56.450
(Sung Je Yeon)

01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:02.690
The person you have called...

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.879
(There was one other face that came to mind.)

01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.479
(If you saw me now, what would you say?)

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.480
(My Youth)

01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:06.720
I was told Sung Je Yeon was here.

01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.490
I'm sorry, Je Yeon.

01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:10.460
When are you free?

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.500
I thought you weren't making a move.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.970
Is a guy like me okay for you?

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.000
When you're too happy,

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.310
it gets scary sometimes.

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:29.110
Do some people remember the first season,

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:32.980
that year, and the first snow?

01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.680
I don't know...

01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:39.750
what will happen now.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:44.760
Still, let's do everything together.
