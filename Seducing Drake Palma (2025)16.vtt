Seducing Drake Palma.

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:35.224
You still haven’t answered
my question, Alys.

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:37.382
Do you still feel the
same way about me,

00:00:38.777 --> 00:00:41.453
or have you forgotten how it
feels like to be in love with me?

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.921
I’m going to court Alys.

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:46.844
That’s fine with you, right?

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:48.750
You like her?

00:00:49.377 --> 00:00:51.713
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:54.757
Hey, Alys!

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.342
Hello, Shaira!

00:00:56.676 --> 00:00:57.860
OMG!

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:59.470
You two are so perfect together!

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:01.639
What’s your problem?

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:06.828
You told me that you
don’t like me anymore.

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:08.371
So I’m trying to forget you.

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:10.314
But why are you making
it so damn impossible?

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:32.721
Date me again, Alys.

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.029
Secretly date me this time.

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:37.018
Are you serious, Drake?

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:40.183
I’m really serious, Alys.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.722
Maybe you’re just feeling cold.

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:45.117
If you don’t want
to hurt anyone,

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:47.420
which I doubt would happen,

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.310
sneak out with me, Alys.

00:01:52.187 --> 00:01:54.815
I don’t want to see you
with Tripp in broad daylight.

00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:58.115
But I’ll still try.

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:01.407
As long as I get to be with you

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.029
when no one’s looking.

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:07.670
Uh, well…

00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:09.365
Drake?

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:11.928
Drake!

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.212
Drake, where are you?

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:15.795
Hubby!

00:03:09.517 --> 00:03:13.319
I love you, Drake Palma!

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.936
Alys!

00:03:20.194 --> 00:03:21.279
- It’s Tripp—
- Shh.

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.538
Walk in first. I’ll follow
after a few minutes.

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:33.166
Huh, why?

00:03:33.916 --> 00:03:35.710
Because we’re secret
lovers, you noob.

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:38.604
Go.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:39.839
Secret lovers?

00:03:40.256 --> 00:03:41.287
Go.

00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:42.600
Okay, fine.

00:03:50.224 --> 00:03:52.059
What just happened?

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:54.793
Secret lovers?!

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.733
Hey, Zy.
Where have you been?

00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:05.889
I’ve been looking for you.

00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:08.256
What?

00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:11.547
Why do you look pale?

00:04:12.997 --> 00:04:14.081
Are you okay?

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:17.835
Hey.

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:21.784
My Dad called.

00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:24.175
He says there’s something
that needs to be done at home.

00:04:24.175 --> 00:04:25.381
Would it be alright
if we go home now?

00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.577
Huh?

00:04:29.122 --> 00:04:30.147
Shall we?

00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:31.532
Is that okay?

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:32.617
Yes.

00:04:32.642 --> 00:04:33.670
Let’s go.

00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:51.412
Shai, we’ll go ahead.
I still have something to do.

00:04:51.494 --> 00:04:52.470
What?

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:55.209
We’ve just seen each other,
then you’re gonna go early.

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.787
Seriously?

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:00.294
Our schools are close
to each other, don’t overreact.

00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:03.064
Come on.
Stay a bit longer.

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:04.373
Please?

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:06.045
Zy, let’s go.

00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:14.016
Ugh, boring.

00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:14.992
Hey.

00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:17.370
Where have you been, mister?

00:05:17.536 --> 00:05:19.694
I’ve been looking for you.

00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:27.224
Why did you and
Drake disappear earlier?

00:05:28.864 --> 00:05:30.467
Did he see us earlier?

00:05:31.242 --> 00:05:34.036
Did he see me being
kissed by Drake?

00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:36.428
Uhm...

00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:38.249
I just got lost.

00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:46.132
Do you like lying, Alys?

00:06:03.687 --> 00:06:05.397
Every girl always wants Drake.

00:06:08.821 --> 00:06:11.228
Should I act mean too,
so you’ll want me instead?

00:06:19.915 --> 00:06:22.209
What do I not have, huh?

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.765
What does Drake
have that I don’t?

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.445
It’s always him that everyone wants.

00:06:33.804 --> 00:06:35.014
Maybe Dad’s right.

00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:38.687
Drake’s better than me.

00:06:42.555 --> 00:06:43.601
Drake.

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:45.453
Drake.

00:06:46.074 --> 00:06:48.952
Drake! Drake! Drake!

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:50.196
Drake!

00:06:50.237 --> 00:06:52.198
- Tripp! Tripp, stop!
- Drake! Drake!

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.425
It’s not your fault.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.507
Then who’s at fault?

00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:03.179
You’re not a bad person, right?

00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:10.531
Just be honest, Zy.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:15.687
If you like someone,
then go for them.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.992
It’s sad for the one
who’ll be left behind.

00:07:23.687 --> 00:07:25.022
It hurts to be left behind, Alys.

00:08:15.656 --> 00:08:19.632
Lord, when will I
move on from Drake?

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:21.871
I’m already hurting
someone else.

00:08:29.712 --> 00:08:31.312
Wait, I’ll do it.

00:08:51.233 --> 00:08:52.273
Alys.

00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:53.711
Alys, Alys…

00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:57.489
Sorry about earlier.

00:09:01.076 --> 00:09:02.179
It’s okay.

00:09:02.828 --> 00:09:04.455
I understand, Tripp.

00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:11.962
But you know we’re
just friends, right?

00:09:13.506 --> 00:09:16.634
If you only see me as a friend,

00:09:17.468 --> 00:09:19.553
I don’t see you that way, Alys.

00:09:20.888 --> 00:09:22.359
Are you numb or what?

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.937
Alys...

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:28.771
I’ve fallen in love with you.

00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:31.172
Don’t you realize?

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:13.493
Both Palmas love me.

00:10:20.197 --> 00:10:22.109
Still sleeping.

00:10:26.328 --> 00:10:27.570
Who is it?

00:10:28.664 --> 00:10:31.850
Someone’s already asleep and someone’s
pestering in the middle of the night.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.419
I’m already sleeping.

00:10:35.754 --> 00:10:36.867
Ugh!

00:10:49.351 --> 00:10:50.429
Who—

00:10:51.145 --> 00:10:51.953
Drake?

00:10:51.978 --> 00:10:52.997
Good evening, Alys.

00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:54.331
Did I wake you?

00:10:54.356 --> 00:10:55.984
Isn’t it obvious?

00:11:00.404 --> 00:11:01.604
What are you doing here?

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:02.711
What time is it?

00:11:03.157 --> 00:11:04.437
Alright then, go to sleep.

00:11:05.284 --> 00:11:06.398
Good night.

00:11:06.994 --> 00:11:08.023
Alys!

00:11:11.109 --> 00:11:11.832
What now?

00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:14.143
I’m here because I’m
trying to sneak out with you.

00:11:14.168 --> 00:11:15.461
It’s barely midnight.

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:19.531
Shall we eat?

00:11:22.212 --> 00:11:23.226
Let’s go.

00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:29.304
Oh, my goodness.

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:31.836
Wait, what?

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:33.336
Sneaking out?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.578
Don’t tell me he’s serious
about what he said before.

00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:03.312
Try this one.
This is good, Alys.

00:12:07.596 --> 00:12:08.601
Go, eat.

00:12:21.568 --> 00:12:22.544
Drake.

00:12:22.616 --> 00:12:23.633
Mmm?

00:12:25.447 --> 00:12:27.000
I don’t like this setup.

00:12:31.662 --> 00:12:36.125
You, me – hiding.

00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:41.562
Tripp, Shaira – being cheated on.

00:12:43.424 --> 00:12:45.509
Are you really
okay with this setup?

00:12:55.936 --> 00:12:57.015
Alys...

00:12:59.273 --> 00:13:00.274
Tripp is my cousin.

00:13:01.859 --> 00:13:03.360
Shaira is my childhood friend.

00:13:04.653 --> 00:13:06.739
Do you think I’m fine
with fooling them?

00:13:09.074 --> 00:13:10.187
Hmm?

00:13:10.576 --> 00:13:11.632
Of course not.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.492
But why am I doing this, Alys?

00:13:15.748 --> 00:13:16.929
The answer is simple.

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:19.251
It’s because I love you.

00:13:20.419 --> 00:13:21.429
That’s why.

00:13:29.277 --> 00:13:30.670
I lost my appetite.

00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:31.738
I’ll see you tomorrow.

00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:50.086
For you.

00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:53.445
Open it later when I leave.

00:13:55.078 --> 00:13:58.437
Wow. He’s been
ignoring me for a week.

00:13:59.124 --> 00:14:02.750
And now he shows up to
give me this with a rule?

00:14:03.045 --> 00:14:04.125
Hmp!

00:14:04.213 --> 00:14:05.606
But to be fair,

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:08.152
I really missed his
shameless attitude.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.515
What is this?

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.655
This is the last one.

00:14:15.022 --> 00:14:16.093
I thought about it.

00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:20.734
I really do love you, Alys.

00:14:23.933 --> 00:14:28.172
But I can’t keep chasing
someone who doesn’t want me.

00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:32.351
- Tripp, come on.
- Sssh.

00:14:33.976 --> 00:14:35.179
This is my decision.

00:14:38.497 --> 00:14:41.117
I know I told you that
I’ll always be here.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.545
Yes, I’m here.

00:14:47.378 --> 00:14:48.976
But only as a friend.

00:14:52.928 --> 00:14:54.281
I’m a man, Alys.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.253
It doesn’t make me happy
to always be the second option.

00:14:59.708 --> 00:15:01.875
Do you know why I
stopped chasing Shaira?

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:06.515
Because she didn’t want me.

00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:09.528
So as for you,

00:15:12.948 --> 00:15:14.116
I’ll stop chasing you.

00:15:18.495 --> 00:15:19.955
Are you mad at me?

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.171
Hey, come on.
Tell me the truth.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.882
Maybe I am.

00:15:32.009 --> 00:15:33.273
Maybe I’m not.

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:39.625
Tripp, be real with me.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:42.914
That’s my secret.

00:15:44.405 --> 00:15:46.783
It’s better you
don’t know, right?

00:15:48.006 --> 00:15:50.759
Seriously, you’re not mad at me?

00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:55.718
Whatever. I’m going.

00:17:33.964 --> 00:17:34.731
Tripp...

00:17:34.756 --> 00:17:35.524
Yes?

00:17:35.549 --> 00:17:37.910
I just left and you
already miss me.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.769
What is this?

00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:46.004
I was there.

00:17:47.728 --> 00:17:49.035
I witnessed all of that.

00:17:52.774 --> 00:17:58.238
I told you, when you cry for the fifth
time, I won’t leave you alone, right?

00:18:01.324 --> 00:18:02.879
But that’s not enough, Alys.

00:18:05.245 --> 00:18:09.833
When you’ve cried ten times,
that’s when I’ll stop.

00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:12.919
Drake is the reason
you’re crying.

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:16.636
He should be the one
to wipe them away.

00:18:19.051 --> 00:18:20.052
Sorry, Alys.

00:18:22.496 --> 00:18:23.789
I can’t do it anymore.

00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:46.119
Thank you!

00:18:52.334 --> 00:18:53.631
I don’t know what to do with you!

00:18:54.377 --> 00:18:55.437
Sent!

00:18:55.469 --> 00:18:56.780
So annoying!

00:19:09.434 --> 00:19:12.014
Hey, bestie, are you okay?

00:19:12.938 --> 00:19:14.481
You look stressed out.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.241
I don’t get you. Do whatever
you want with your life!

00:19:28.185 --> 00:19:29.931
Are you okay, bestie?

00:19:29.955 --> 00:19:31.522
It’s like you’re the one
who’s stressed out.

00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:33.834
Looks like your fight
with Kent is serious.

00:19:35.794 --> 00:19:37.420
I don’t want to talk about it.

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:41.007
I just want good vibes.
Just be happy.

00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:43.635
How about yours?

00:19:44.511 --> 00:19:46.350
You’ve been restless since earlier.

00:19:47.639 --> 00:19:51.373
Should I tell my bestie that my
problem is about the Palma cousins?

00:19:51.935 --> 00:19:56.123
She might get bad vibes again
and take out her anger at Kent on me.

00:19:56.885 --> 00:19:58.553
Nothing, it’s just about school.

00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:00.850
Are you sure?

00:20:01.403 --> 00:20:04.489
You met up with me
for “just school”?

00:20:06.158 --> 00:20:09.420
Bestie, I’m in a really
difficult situation right now.

00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:13.647
You know, when it comes to culinary
arts courses, I’m doing good.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.170
But when it comes to Math
and other subjects, I’m in trouble.

00:20:19.254 --> 00:20:21.631
- Oh my gosh, I’m screwed.
- Bestie...

00:20:21.756 --> 00:20:23.077
You want that, right?

00:20:23.425 --> 00:20:24.733
Stand by it.

00:20:25.635 --> 00:20:26.662
Stand by it!

00:20:32.017 --> 00:20:33.059
Where are you?

00:20:33.728 --> 00:20:34.952
Ignore, ignore.

00:20:35.512 --> 00:20:36.653
Goodness!

00:20:38.138 --> 00:20:39.772
It’s suffocating sometimes.

00:20:40.317 --> 00:20:41.359
What’s suffocating?

00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:43.241
Who texted you?

00:20:45.447 --> 00:20:46.740
Bestie, tell me.

00:20:47.553 --> 00:20:48.803
It’s Drake.

00:20:49.242 --> 00:20:50.218
What?

00:20:50.243 --> 00:20:52.387
Is it true? Really?

00:20:52.412 --> 00:20:53.305
Yes!

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:54.584
You two are texting again?

00:20:54.632 --> 00:20:55.765
I said yes!

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.209
Why didn’t you reply?

00:20:57.918 --> 00:20:59.227
I don’t know.

00:20:59.252 --> 00:21:02.631
He might as well put a tracking device
on me so he’ll stop bothering me.

00:21:04.424 --> 00:21:05.842
Bestie, you know what?

00:21:06.238 --> 00:21:07.287
Mmm?

00:21:07.719 --> 00:21:09.905
You’ve come a long way.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:10.864
Hmm?

00:21:10.889 --> 00:21:12.069
I mean, look at you.

00:21:12.224 --> 00:21:15.076
You were the one going
after Drake before.

00:21:15.101 --> 00:21:17.147
You even forced him
to be your boyfriend.

00:21:18.355 --> 00:21:21.600
“Drake Palma, you’re
my boyfriend now!”

00:21:21.733 --> 00:21:25.587
“One, two, three!
We’re done!”

00:21:25.612 --> 00:21:27.077
Do I really talk like that?

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.756
Yes, you can even do it now.

00:21:30.825 --> 00:21:32.035
- You jerk.
- Look at you.

00:21:32.077 --> 00:21:33.217
You jerk!

00:21:33.242 --> 00:21:36.514
Now look, he’s the one
going after you.

00:21:36.539 --> 00:21:37.474
Isn’t it amazing?

00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:38.350
I don’t know.

00:21:38.375 --> 00:21:39.626
What should I say?

00:21:39.668 --> 00:21:42.037
I’m happy because
Drake is chasing me?

00:21:42.337 --> 00:21:45.048
Also, that term “being
chased” sounds bad.

00:21:45.173 --> 00:21:45.465
Oh?

00:21:45.465 --> 00:21:48.510
Isn’t being chased mean I’m running
because someone’s chasing me?

00:21:48.802 --> 00:21:49.934
That’s so weird.

00:21:51.082 --> 00:21:53.001
So that’s your setup now?

00:21:53.974 --> 00:21:55.895
No wonder you’ve been
spacing out earlier.

00:21:56.434 --> 00:21:59.454
That’s why, bestie. I’m
really out of it right now.

00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:01.439
And finals are only
two weeks away.

00:22:01.898 --> 00:22:06.294
And now there’s Drake,
the one I’m always with at night.

00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:09.172
And Tripp, the one I’m
always with in the morning.

00:22:09.197 --> 00:22:10.615
I’m so busy right now, bestie.

00:22:10.657 --> 00:22:11.841
I’m confused.

00:22:11.866 --> 00:22:15.043
Wow, you have shifting schedule?

00:22:15.412 --> 00:22:16.504
Are you a nurse?

00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:18.999
- “Shifting?”
- “Shifting?”

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:21.770
I don’t know.

00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:23.211
It’s stressful.

00:22:23.236 --> 00:22:23.812
Oh!

00:22:23.837 --> 00:22:25.922
Bestie, isn’t there an event at
Brenford today?

00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:27.190
So?

00:22:27.215 --> 00:22:32.988
Well, let’s clean up.
Because we’re going there now.

00:22:33.013 --> 00:22:35.520
I don’t want to.
You go ahead.

00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:39.668
Bestie, come on.
We don’t get to bond very often.

00:22:39.936 --> 00:22:40.979
Come on, let’s go.

00:22:41.646 --> 00:22:43.273
Hurry up. Let’s go.

00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:44.316
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

00:22:44.357 --> 00:22:45.692
What else can I do?
You’re the one who invited me.

00:22:45.717 --> 00:22:47.961
See, I haven’t even had a sip.

00:22:47.986 --> 00:22:49.840
Come on, let’s go.
Hurry up. You’re so slow.

00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:51.911
Wait, hold on!

00:22:55.368 --> 00:22:56.953
You’re such in a rush, bestie.

00:22:57.704 --> 00:22:58.830
This is so good.

00:23:00.749 --> 00:23:02.959
Is their fight really that bad?

00:23:03.551 --> 00:23:04.686
Uhm...Bee?

00:23:04.711 --> 00:23:05.848
Stop it!

00:23:06.254 --> 00:23:08.715
Why are you here, Mr. Valdez?

00:23:09.507 --> 00:23:12.293
I already told you
I don’t want to see you!

00:23:13.011 --> 00:23:14.614
You’re really a stalker, aren’t you?

00:23:16.514 --> 00:23:18.575
I saw on your story
that you were here, so…

00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:20.676
I came to see you.

00:23:24.272 --> 00:23:27.184
Bee, I’m so sorry!

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:30.362
Forgive me, please!

00:23:31.905 --> 00:23:33.121
Sorry, huh?

00:23:33.146 --> 00:23:35.653
Apology not accepted!

00:23:38.036 --> 00:23:41.207
I don’t want to talk,
the aura here is scary.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.567
This aura even beats Drake’s when
he dragged me after seeing me with Tripp.

00:23:46.378 --> 00:23:47.670
- Bee!
- What?

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.633
Excuse me, it looks
like you two need to talk.

00:23:55.887 --> 00:23:58.786
It won’t happen again, Bee.
I promise.

00:23:58.932 --> 00:24:00.301
You won’t do it again?

00:24:00.725 --> 00:24:02.143
Come on, Kent!

00:24:02.837 --> 00:24:04.496
You’re such a mess.

00:24:04.896 --> 00:24:06.176
I’m sorry, Bee.

00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:13.051
I’m so sorry, Bee!
Don’t leave me, please!

00:24:22.997 --> 00:24:25.041
I wonder how Kent
and Aya are doing.

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:27.085
I hope they’re okay.

00:24:28.545 --> 00:24:30.672
Ugh, wherever I go,
there’s always drama.

00:24:31.908 --> 00:24:35.629
I can’t go to Brenford because
Tripp’s there, I’d feel so guilty.

00:24:37.137 --> 00:24:40.056
I can’t go to the condo
either because Drake’s there.

00:24:42.267 --> 00:24:44.035
It’s better to just
stay here at home.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.676
No one will bother me.

00:24:46.646 --> 00:24:48.398
And I can actually study properly.

00:24:59.784 --> 00:25:01.149
Aunt Katrina...

00:25:03.496 --> 00:25:05.123
How are you, Aunt?

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.251
I’m fine. And the baby, too.

00:25:09.085 --> 00:25:10.587
That’s good to hear.

00:25:12.255 --> 00:25:13.610
How about you?

00:25:14.215 --> 00:25:15.610
How are you and Drake?

00:25:16.426 --> 00:25:18.553
Huh? What?

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.852
I know I don’t have
the right to say this.

00:25:27.854 --> 00:25:29.022
Please don’t hurt him.

00:25:30.732 --> 00:25:32.484
What do you mean?

00:25:34.194 --> 00:25:35.361
I know him, Alys.

00:25:36.446 --> 00:25:38.948
Steve and I went
to his unit yesterday.

00:25:40.116 --> 00:25:43.036
Even if he doesn’t tell us,
we can tell he’s got a problem.

00:25:44.204 --> 00:25:46.831
But Drake and I don’t
have any problems, Aunt.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.418
Then good, if you
don’t have problems.

00:25:51.753 --> 00:25:52.795
But, Alys,

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.715
Drake may look tough,

00:25:57.258 --> 00:25:58.738
but inside,

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:02.792
he’s just as vulnerable
as everybody else.

00:26:03.598 --> 00:26:04.972
Please keep that in mind.

00:26:06.976 --> 00:26:08.102
Thank you, Aunt.

00:26:08.978 --> 00:26:11.064
Thank you that you’re
concerned about Drake,

00:26:11.856 --> 00:26:13.503
your concerned about us.

00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:15.620
No problem.

00:26:17.737 --> 00:26:19.972
What’s the baby’s
gender and name?

00:26:21.055 --> 00:26:25.267
A boy – and his name is
Ethos Sebastian Palma.

00:26:25.537 --> 00:26:26.486
Wow!

00:26:26.511 --> 00:26:28.515
I hope he’s as smart
as his older brother.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.334
Oh, I hope he doesn’t have
the same mood swings as his brother.

00:26:34.003 --> 00:26:35.495
Oh, he kicked?

00:26:36.881 --> 00:26:38.424
He heard us.

00:26:39.008 --> 00:26:40.235
You want to listen?

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.441
May I?

00:26:41.553 --> 00:26:42.667
Come close.

00:26:44.323 --> 00:26:46.480
Hi, Ethos!

00:26:46.641 --> 00:26:48.142
Gosh, he can’t stay still.

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:50.520
He kicked again.

00:26:51.312 --> 00:26:53.690
He’s so active, like a
football player, Aunt.

00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:56.776
Bee, come on.
I’m sorry, please.

00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:00.780
Kent, you should’ve thought about
what would come out of your mouth

00:27:00.805 --> 00:27:02.287
so you wouldn’t be
apologizing now.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.312
I’m sorry, Bee.

00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:07.887
I really won’t do
it again, I promise!

00:27:07.912 --> 00:27:10.443
Why do you say all
sorts of things?

00:27:10.707 --> 00:27:11.959
Sheen and I?

00:27:12.208 --> 00:27:14.889
You should be disgusted!
Eeww!

00:27:15.837 --> 00:27:16.838
I’m really sorry.

00:27:18.047 --> 00:27:19.834
I’m just jealous of Sheen.

00:27:21.843 --> 00:27:22.858
Yuck, Kent!

00:27:23.595 --> 00:27:25.888
Has your brain melted
from economics?

00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:27.834
Ugh!

00:27:28.266 --> 00:27:30.226
I’m grossed out by
what you’re saying!

00:27:30.643 --> 00:27:33.326
Come on, Bee. It’s because
you’re always together.

00:27:34.522 --> 00:27:35.999
I’m just jealous.

00:27:36.024 --> 00:27:37.400
You’re jealous of nothing!

00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:40.997
Yuck! I’m not into CB!

00:27:41.022 --> 00:27:43.014
What if Sheen likes you?

00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:45.584
Sheen doesn’t like me!

00:27:46.075 --> 00:27:49.178
Besides, you’re my boyfriend.
Isn’t that enough?

00:27:50.663 --> 00:27:52.123
Wow, you’re so choosy!

00:27:55.752 --> 00:27:56.967
Go on.

00:27:57.387 --> 00:28:01.264
Say this first,
“I love you so much, Kent.”

00:28:01.382 --> 00:28:02.483
You wish!

00:28:05.146 --> 00:28:06.951
That’s why I love you so much.

00:28:07.491 --> 00:28:08.826
You’re so mean.

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.053
Come on, let’s go on a date!

00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:16.831
I missed you, Bee!
We’re good now!

00:28:16.856 --> 00:28:17.690
Date me, okay?

00:28:17.732 --> 00:28:19.208
You’re so bipolar, Kent!

00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:20.960
Stay here. Safety first.

00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:22.162
Oh, my god!

00:28:44.926 --> 00:28:46.006
Coast is clear.

00:28:48.304 --> 00:28:51.766
I’m already regretting choosing
a condo unit here.

00:28:52.725 --> 00:28:55.037
I could run into Drake anytime.

00:28:56.604 --> 00:28:57.772
I need to be careful.

00:29:01.317 --> 00:29:02.318
Alys.

00:29:04.362 --> 00:29:05.571
I failed already.

00:29:07.323 --> 00:29:09.242
Hi, Drake! I didn’t see you there.

00:29:14.497 --> 00:29:15.740
Are you hiding from me?

00:29:17.025 --> 00:29:18.271
Of course not!

00:29:19.585 --> 00:29:22.505
So, why didn’t you reply to
my messages since morning?

00:29:24.674 --> 00:29:25.725
Uhm...

00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:27.803
Alone time!

00:29:28.138 --> 00:29:30.182
Sometimes it’s good to
make someone miss you.

00:29:34.016 --> 00:29:35.326
Come on, hey!

00:29:35.351 --> 00:29:36.733
Don’t be so serious.

00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:42.100
Sorry for being this paranoid.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:45.404
I just can’t help it, Alys.

00:29:47.238 --> 00:29:48.451
Please don’t dump me.

00:29:51.159 --> 00:29:54.537
You can destroy what I have.
And you’re the only one I have left, Alys.

00:29:55.747 --> 00:29:56.756
Drake.

00:29:58.708 --> 00:29:59.709
Let’s have dinner.

00:30:03.421 --> 00:30:04.797
I already ate at home.

00:30:06.883 --> 00:30:09.844
Can we talk tomorrow instead?

00:30:11.888 --> 00:30:13.222
Is there a problem, Alys?

00:30:17.059 --> 00:30:18.102
I’m just tired.

00:30:22.231 --> 00:30:23.649
I want to rest.

00:30:27.445 --> 00:30:28.780
Thanks for your honesty.

00:30:30.055 --> 00:30:31.193
I’ll see you tomorrow.

00:31:00.102 --> 00:31:01.854
I hope you understand, baby.

00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:08.486
I agreed to this, Mom.

00:31:09.111 --> 00:31:12.725
I agreed that if I fail
even just one subject,

00:31:13.241 --> 00:31:14.992
you’ll send me to the States.

00:31:16.118 --> 00:31:20.623
I have no choice but to just
honor my part of the agreement.

00:31:24.126 --> 00:31:25.279
I’m sorry, Mom.

00:31:26.128 --> 00:31:27.296
I really tried.

00:31:28.172 --> 00:31:31.483
Sorry, baby.
We had an agreement.

00:31:32.385 --> 00:31:33.701
It’s okay, Mom.

00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:35.770
Thanks for giving me a chance.

00:31:35.795 --> 00:31:38.272
No problem, baby. I’ll go ahead.

00:32:23.352 --> 00:32:24.558
What’s that?

00:32:30.568 --> 00:32:31.581
Who is that?

00:32:45.583 --> 00:32:46.597
Drake?

00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:49.871
Good morning!

00:32:53.507 --> 00:32:54.644
What time is it?

00:32:55.384 --> 00:32:57.178
It’s already past 10:00 AM.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.390
Oh, Alys, aren’t you
supposed to avoid him?

00:33:02.475 --> 00:33:03.893
Should you send him away?

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:07.105
But isn’t this what you wanted?

00:33:07.647 --> 00:33:10.524
That somehow, he’d woo you
and choose you?

00:33:11.108 --> 00:33:12.167
This is it.

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:16.781
One night ago, he left you
because you didn’t want secrets.

00:33:17.448 --> 00:33:18.783
But what can you do?

00:33:19.415 --> 00:33:20.959
And you also sent that...

00:33:22.328 --> 00:33:25.206
Has he seen it already?
That’s why he’s here even it’s still early.

00:33:25.972 --> 00:33:26.988
Drake?

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.769
Mmm?

00:33:29.675 --> 00:33:30.808
I’m sorry.

00:33:32.463 --> 00:33:33.397
Why?

00:33:33.422 --> 00:33:35.466
For hurting my feelings
over and over again?

00:33:36.968 --> 00:33:38.427
I already said sorry.

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.513
And have you checked your FB?

00:33:40.638 --> 00:33:41.644
What?

00:33:42.181 --> 00:33:44.225
I said, have you
checked your FB?

00:33:46.143 --> 00:33:48.729
What does my FB account
have to do with you hurting me?

00:33:48.729 --> 00:33:50.597
Just check it.

00:33:59.448 --> 00:34:00.509
Log in.

00:34:01.943 --> 00:34:03.189
Relationship request?

00:34:04.411 --> 00:34:05.412
Accept it, okay?

00:34:11.853 --> 00:34:14.689
And don’t worry, Shaira
and I aren’t friends on FB.

00:34:14.714 --> 00:34:18.657
And if she sees it, by any chance,
I’ll explain to her.

00:34:19.093 --> 00:34:20.118
Is that okay?

00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:33.384
[In French] Only you. I love you, Alys.

00:34:33.482 --> 00:34:35.568
Only you. I love you.

00:34:46.078 --> 00:34:47.907
Why just on the neck?

00:34:48.834 --> 00:34:51.009
Brush your teeth first
before I kiss you on the lips.

00:34:51.946 --> 00:34:55.931
Darn it, I was actually feeling giddy. But
he shows some toothbrush spiel he knows.

00:34:57.006 --> 00:34:59.091
Oh well, The Drake Palma Way it is.

00:35:04.297 --> 00:35:06.174
Get dressed after you eat, okay?

00:35:07.558 --> 00:35:08.579
Why?

00:35:09.769 --> 00:35:11.829
Tripp went fishing
with Uncle Tristan.

00:35:11.854 --> 00:35:13.439
Shaira went shopping
somewhere far away.

00:35:14.648 --> 00:35:15.907
So we’re gonna go on a date,

00:35:16.752 --> 00:35:17.753
online girlfriend.

00:35:23.532 --> 00:35:24.782
OMG!

00:35:25.326 --> 00:35:27.111
Sorry, Tripp and Shaira.

00:35:27.495 --> 00:35:29.439
I swear I’m going
to tell you both soon.

00:35:29.789 --> 00:35:33.417
I can’t keep Drake a secret
anymore. My heart will explode.

00:35:35.878 --> 00:35:38.415
Uhm, where are we going?

00:35:38.506 --> 00:35:39.579
Just somewhere.

00:35:43.353 --> 00:35:44.368
Noob.

00:35:46.472 --> 00:35:47.281
Noob!

00:35:47.306 --> 00:35:48.306
Mmm?

00:35:48.572 --> 00:35:49.633
Where are we going?

00:35:54.331 --> 00:35:55.751
Why are we in a cemetery?

00:36:15.709 --> 00:36:16.720
Here.

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.106
Give this to my mom.
She’ll like you.

00:36:32.693 --> 00:36:34.194
Goodness, Alys!

00:36:34.436 --> 00:36:36.747
Don’t expect he’d
open the door for you.

00:36:36.772 --> 00:36:40.025
In a year of being together, he never
opened the door for you.

00:36:40.943 --> 00:36:42.064
Hmp!

00:36:42.778 --> 00:36:44.155
Okay, fine.

00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:14.493
Wow, Drake, your
mom is so pretty.

00:37:14.935 --> 00:37:16.562
I thought Aunt Katrina
looks like an angel.

00:37:16.587 --> 00:37:17.822
But she’s even more angelic.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.736
No wonder Drake looks hot.
His mom is pretty.

00:37:24.653 --> 00:37:28.103
Hi, mom! This is my
strange girlfriend, Alys.

00:37:28.532 --> 00:37:29.970
Alys, this is my mom.

00:37:31.202 --> 00:37:34.096
Uhm, hello, Drake’s mom.

00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:35.126
Tss.

00:37:35.956 --> 00:37:38.726
She’s my mom.
Call her “Mom”, too.

00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:41.103
I don’t want to.
We’re not married yet.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:46.579
If you’ll wait for our marriage just
to call her “Mom,” you’ll wait in vain.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.454
I won’t propose to you
until you turn 28.

00:37:50.054 --> 00:37:51.212
And why is that?

00:37:51.805 --> 00:37:53.329
I’m only 18, you know.

00:37:53.474 --> 00:37:54.850
So I’ll wait for 10 years?

00:37:54.892 --> 00:37:59.017
Both your dads made me promise not to
be intimate with you until you turn 20.

00:37:59.313 --> 00:38:01.398
And not to propose to you
until you turn 28.

00:38:01.649 --> 00:38:03.125
So, yeah, you should wait.

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.235
You’re too much.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.272
If you want my body,
Alys, wait for two years.

00:38:08.989 --> 00:38:12.954
I’ll give in on the night of your
20th birthday, don’t worry.

00:38:13.827 --> 00:38:16.347
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

00:38:16.372 --> 00:38:17.665
Alys, no, I’m not.

00:38:18.165 --> 00:38:20.673
If I’m out of my mind,
I’ll kiss you senseless right now.

00:38:21.335 --> 00:38:23.545
But since I’m not,
I’ll wait for two years.

00:38:25.381 --> 00:38:28.275
I wish the ground
would swallow me.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.053
I’m embarrassed by what
Palma is saying.

00:38:36.475 --> 00:38:37.486
For you.

00:38:40.938 --> 00:38:41.947
For you, Mom.

00:38:55.703 --> 00:38:56.915
As I’ve said, Mom...

00:38:57.913 --> 00:38:59.454
This is my girlfriend, Alys.

00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:05.478
I’ve told you before
that I like pretty girls.

00:39:07.193 --> 00:39:08.402
But I love her.

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:12.587
So to hell with physical appearance.
She’s cute, right?

00:39:13.679 --> 00:39:15.698
Somebody stop me.

00:39:15.723 --> 00:39:19.184
I’ll strangle him, even though I
get giddy despite his insults.

00:39:20.477 --> 00:39:21.854
Dad will have a baby soon.

00:39:23.063 --> 00:39:25.314
Hopefully, he’ll be less clingy to me.

00:39:25.482 --> 00:39:27.220
You’ve met Aunt Katrina, right?

00:39:27.651 --> 00:39:30.790
It’s the first time he
called her “Aunt”.

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:35.576
She’s been kind to me.
So I’m trying not to hate her anymore.

00:39:35.826 --> 00:39:37.478
She’s going to be
my brother’s mom.

00:39:37.953 --> 00:39:39.447
I hope you’d like her too, Mom.

00:39:39.788 --> 00:39:41.874
Dad loves her…I think.

00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:44.384
Anyway, Mom —

00:39:45.544 --> 00:39:47.921
Alys has everything
I don’t like in a girl.

00:39:48.797 --> 00:39:52.384
She’s annoying, she’s a noob,
she’s obnoxious, she’s clingy.

00:39:53.385 --> 00:39:54.837
But I love her.

00:39:56.013 --> 00:39:58.297
Get it together, Drake.
I’ll bite you later.

00:39:58.322 --> 00:40:00.157
And she can be
hurtful too, Mom, look.

00:40:01.352 --> 00:40:04.275
She always pulls my hair,
she bites me, she kicks me,

00:40:04.952 --> 00:40:06.203
but I still love her.

00:40:15.908 --> 00:40:17.242
Are you proposing?

00:40:20.245 --> 00:40:21.775
And she’s assuming, Mom.

00:40:22.492 --> 00:40:24.259
I don’t even know why I love her.

00:40:25.334 --> 00:40:27.211
You’ve got a
memory of a bird, Alys.

00:40:27.961 --> 00:40:30.297
Didn't I tell you I won't propose
to you until you turn 28?

00:40:31.173 --> 00:40:32.900
Then why do you have a box like that?

00:40:32.925 --> 00:40:33.947
This one?

00:40:39.298 --> 00:40:41.454
I was supposed to give this
on the night of your birthday.

00:40:42.226 --> 00:40:43.352
But I messed up.

00:40:43.685 --> 00:40:45.579
So I can only give it to you now.

00:40:55.989 --> 00:40:56.965
Drake!

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.535
Oh no! This can’t be!

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:01.353
It’s my birthday today!

00:41:02.454 --> 00:41:03.462
Drake?

00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:08.502
What really happened
to you on my debut?

00:41:09.878 --> 00:41:11.923
Alys, that’s not my story to tell.

00:41:12.965 --> 00:41:14.243
But I’ll still tell you.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.569
You don’t have to answer
if you don’t want to.

00:41:17.594 --> 00:41:18.642
It’s okay.

00:41:26.603 --> 00:41:27.896
I should tell you this.

00:41:28.772 --> 00:41:31.358
That night, Shaira needed me.

00:41:33.777 --> 00:41:35.681
Shaira has suicidal tendencies.

00:41:36.613 --> 00:41:39.032
I don’t even know why
she has those tendencies.

00:41:39.575 --> 00:41:40.909
She has everything —

00:41:42.943 --> 00:41:44.142
a complete family,

00:41:44.804 --> 00:41:46.282
she gets what she wants.

00:41:47.416 --> 00:41:50.043
But still, she spirals
when she gets depressed.

00:41:51.128 --> 00:41:54.047
That’s why she always
wears bangles and a watch.

00:41:59.178 --> 00:42:02.055
Is it to cover her wounds?

00:42:03.765 --> 00:42:04.861
That night,

00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:07.603
I was about to go to your debut.

00:42:08.145 --> 00:42:11.064
I was about to get out of the
car to greet you happy birthday,

00:42:12.024 --> 00:42:13.901
but then her nanny called.

00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:15.157
She did it again.

00:42:15.861 --> 00:42:17.009
What happened, nanny?

00:42:17.446 --> 00:42:22.301
Sir Drake, come here!
Hurry! It’s Ma’am Shaira!

00:42:22.326 --> 00:42:23.327
Again?

00:42:26.538 --> 00:42:27.623
I was forced to go.

00:42:28.037 --> 00:42:30.623
Because they know I’m the only
one who could stop her.

00:42:31.598 --> 00:42:32.641
She’s crazy.

00:42:33.827 --> 00:42:34.915
She’s annoying.

00:42:35.106 --> 00:42:36.462
She’s driving me nuts.

00:42:36.983 --> 00:42:37.986
Drake!

00:42:39.593 --> 00:42:42.767
That’s why I couldn’t leave her.
She’s my best friend.

00:42:43.472 --> 00:42:45.098
I needed to break the door.

00:42:45.828 --> 00:42:48.345
She locked it and threatened me

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:50.312
that she will hurt herself.

00:42:55.651 --> 00:42:56.775
Shaira!

00:42:57.748 --> 00:42:59.041
And the night you ran off?

00:43:00.239 --> 00:43:03.033
The night you saw us
come out of the bathroom...

00:43:04.482 --> 00:43:08.069
I know you have a dirty mind, Alys.
So you probably thought wrong.

00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:11.875
I swear, Alys, my
hands are pure.

00:43:12.751 --> 00:43:13.986
I think.

00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:15.627
I didn’t touch her one bit.

00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:20.383
Wow, all my doubts
were for nothing?

00:43:21.343 --> 00:43:22.553
Now that everything’s clear,

00:43:25.597 --> 00:43:29.518
will you accept this strawberry
as a sign of my affection for you?

00:43:47.911 --> 00:43:50.956
But why are you
telling me all this now?

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.724
Why didn’t you tell me before?

00:43:52.749 --> 00:43:53.829
Because…

00:43:56.253 --> 00:43:57.314
I don’t know.

00:43:58.964 --> 00:44:03.064
Can you not think about the
past and focus on the present?

00:44:04.303 --> 00:44:05.804
Let’s just be happy, Alys.

00:44:07.306 --> 00:44:09.474
Let’s not think about what’s
going to happen tomorrow.

00:44:10.813 --> 00:44:12.009
Would that be alright, Alys?

00:44:13.645 --> 00:44:15.497
Can you do that for me?

00:44:15.522 --> 00:44:16.525
For us?

00:44:19.026 --> 00:44:20.361
Yes, Drake, but…

00:44:20.944 --> 00:44:22.032
But what now?

00:44:24.156 --> 00:44:25.866
But I’ll be your girlfriend

00:44:25.866 --> 00:44:28.619
once everything’s okay
with Tripp and Shaira, okay?

00:44:29.828 --> 00:44:33.165
I’ll be your girlfriend once again,
if that’s alright with you.

00:44:34.583 --> 00:44:36.460
I’ll see you again
tomorrow, after exams.

00:44:38.003 --> 00:44:39.630
Thanks for the
strawberry, Drake.

00:44:47.971 --> 00:44:49.001
I miss you, Mom.

00:45:13.246 --> 00:45:16.083
You’re taking lots of pictures.
Just because it’s the last day?

00:45:20.045 --> 00:45:21.103
Smile, Zy.

00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:29.153
You ignored me for days after…

00:45:34.518 --> 00:45:38.197
It’s just that,
you’re like my best friend.

00:45:38.438 --> 00:45:40.431
Then you start saying
all these things.

00:45:44.361 --> 00:45:45.384
Hey.

00:45:46.144 --> 00:45:48.048
Talk to me, please.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.915
I won’t stop bugging you, swear!

00:45:56.498 --> 00:45:58.095
I’ll treat you.
It’s on me.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.835
Whatever.

00:46:00.548 --> 00:46:01.767
Wow.

00:46:01.878 --> 00:46:03.130
I’m treating you, and
you’re still like that.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:04.514
Forever grumpy.

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.439
Now I can really say you
and Drake are cousins.

00:46:09.798 --> 00:46:11.392
Come on, please.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:17.828
Another picture.

00:46:17.853 --> 00:46:18.895
- Smile again.
- So, what now?

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.868
Let’s go?

00:46:21.565 --> 00:46:22.603
Where exactly are you taking me?

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:25.056
Taking you, really?

00:46:25.277 --> 00:46:26.337
Acting like a girl, huh?

00:46:28.655 --> 00:46:30.072
I’m not courting you anymore.

00:46:30.657 --> 00:46:31.992
I’ve got the right to be grumpy.

00:46:34.077 --> 00:46:35.064
Whatever.

00:46:35.203 --> 00:46:35.929
Let’s go!

00:46:35.954 --> 00:46:37.314
Let’s go somewhere.

00:46:37.539 --> 00:46:38.775
Let’s hang out.

00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:40.915
Remember this, Tripp?

00:46:44.504 --> 00:46:45.454
Freshman walk.

00:46:45.547 --> 00:46:46.648
Exactly!

00:46:46.673 --> 00:46:47.966
This is where you left me!

00:46:48.467 --> 00:46:49.478
You’re such a jerk!

00:46:55.265 --> 00:46:57.259
- Alys.
- Mmm?

00:47:00.103 --> 00:47:01.142
I’m leaving.

00:47:01.143 --> 00:47:20.024

Where are you going this time?

00:47:07.694 --> 00:47:08.737
- Huh?
- Secret.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.506
You know too much.

00:47:11.531 --> 00:47:13.325
So, where are you
going on vacation?

00:47:16.912 --> 00:47:17.954
It’s not a vacation.

00:47:22.542 --> 00:47:23.782
I’m really leaving.

00:47:29.508 --> 00:47:30.509
For good.

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.064
Seriously?

00:47:36.556 --> 00:47:37.572
Not a prank?

00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:41.384
Is it because of me?

00:47:43.647 --> 00:47:45.376
Are you still mad at me?

00:47:46.483 --> 00:47:47.943
I thought we were good.

00:48:04.918 --> 00:48:06.439
You’re overthinking, Zy.

00:48:07.879 --> 00:48:09.306
I’ve planned this
for a long time ago.

00:48:11.758 --> 00:48:12.798
What plan?

00:48:19.474 --> 00:48:21.059
I was only staying here for a sem.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.423
I never really planned
to enroll in Brenford.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.493
The truth is,

00:48:29.067 --> 00:48:31.403
I was planning to study
photography abroad,

00:48:33.285 --> 00:48:34.603
even if Dad doesn’t approve.

00:48:36.283 --> 00:48:37.650
Is that really the reason?

00:48:45.166 --> 00:48:46.212
I’m good.

00:48:47.627 --> 00:48:48.634
Are you okay?

00:48:51.131 --> 00:48:52.306
So, let’s go home.

00:49:04.561 --> 00:49:06.798
You’re not mad at me, are you?

00:49:10.567 --> 00:49:11.611
Believe me, Zy.

00:49:13.612 --> 00:49:14.704
I’m not mad at you.

00:49:21.869 --> 00:49:24.142
Tripp, I’ll miss you.

00:49:26.082 --> 00:49:27.290
I’ll miss you, too.

00:50:02.744 --> 00:50:03.995
Goodbye, Alys.

00:50:29.145 --> 00:50:30.173
Tripp.

00:50:33.066 --> 00:50:34.079
Drake.

00:50:35.888 --> 00:50:36.899
Let’s talk.

00:50:44.911 --> 00:50:45.923
Yeah?

00:50:46.663 --> 00:50:48.581
What can I do for you, your highness?

00:50:49.457 --> 00:50:51.040
I’m here because of Alys.

00:50:52.961 --> 00:50:54.379
So, what about Alys?

00:50:55.171 --> 00:50:56.415
Because of this exhibit?

00:50:57.841 --> 00:50:59.884
Don’t worry, you’re welcome here.

00:51:00.677 --> 00:51:01.845
Stay away from her.

00:51:05.515 --> 00:51:06.540
Who do you think you are?

00:51:07.434 --> 00:51:08.435
Leave Alys alone.

00:51:09.185 --> 00:51:11.396
We both know you
don’t really like her.

00:51:14.274 --> 00:51:17.485
Just because you’re smart,
it doesn’t mean you know what I feel.

00:51:18.987 --> 00:51:22.407
Yes, at first, I wanted
to get even with you.

00:51:26.236 --> 00:51:27.384
But I fell for her.

00:51:29.873 --> 00:51:31.048
I love Alys, Drake.

00:51:35.837 --> 00:51:36.837
Tripp...

00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:39.572
Stop chasing after Alys, please.

00:51:40.175 --> 00:51:41.439
This time, let it be me.

00:51:44.554 --> 00:51:46.189
This time, let it be you?

00:51:48.933 --> 00:51:50.048
Wow, Drake, really?

00:51:51.102 --> 00:51:53.720
What do you mean “this
time,” when it’s always you.

00:51:55.573 --> 00:51:56.665
Haven’t you noticed?

00:51:59.903 --> 00:52:02.970
In this family, you’re
always the golden boy.

00:52:03.615 --> 00:52:04.697
Why?

00:52:05.992 --> 00:52:07.868
Just because your mom
died when you were young,

00:52:08.411 --> 00:52:10.829
the whole family has
to take care of you?

00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:14.267
Only Drake is the great one.

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:17.337
Only Drake has to be cared for.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.720
You always want the attention.

00:52:22.717 --> 00:52:26.554
Why do you think
I skip family reunions, Tripp?

00:52:29.516 --> 00:52:31.673
It’s because you might
think you’re the victim again.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.938
Why did I study at SCA?

00:52:35.611 --> 00:52:37.142
Even though I didn’t want to, Tripp.

00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:41.653
Because I didn’t want you to think
I was competing with you.

00:52:42.403 --> 00:52:45.115
Now, am I still the one
who wants attention?

00:52:52.497 --> 00:52:53.581
Only this time, Tripp.

00:52:53.822 --> 00:52:57.032
I’m begging you.
Stay away from Alys.

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.045
It’s your turn to let go.

00:53:00.922 --> 00:53:02.257
She’s the only one I want.

00:53:04.634 --> 00:53:08.471
Please, Tripp. After this,
only Shaira will be my problem.

00:53:10.974 --> 00:53:13.226
You’re not the same
Drake I used to know.

00:53:14.936 --> 00:53:16.618
The one who had no stand,

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.357
the one giving false hope.

00:53:20.514 --> 00:53:22.057
You changed a lot.

Don’t waste the time
you get to spend with her.

00:53:43.464 --> 00:53:44.556
Hello, son?

00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:46.843
Yes, Dad? Why?

00:53:48.156 --> 00:53:50.704
Are you sure about
what you said last night?

00:53:51.316 --> 00:53:52.501
You’re serious?

00:53:53.782 --> 00:53:55.643
Oh, yes, Dad.

00:53:56.829 --> 00:54:00.439
I don’t want Brenford anymore.
I’ll go to New York.

00:54:01.149 --> 00:54:02.353
Alright, son.

00:54:02.483 --> 00:54:03.892
That’s a good decision.

00:54:04.652 --> 00:54:06.696
I’ll take care of
your transfer papers.

00:54:07.155 --> 00:54:08.314
Okay, Dad. Thank you.

00:54:19.375 --> 00:54:21.517
Drake, I really tried my best.

00:54:22.304 --> 00:54:24.265
I tried so hard.

00:54:25.548 --> 00:54:29.517
But it seems you’ve
made up your mind.

00:54:31.221 --> 00:54:37.337
You have the courage now to
fight for Alys... to fight for love.

00:54:37.393 --> 00:54:39.145
I guess this is it.

00:54:39.771 --> 00:54:43.524
I’ll leave the Philippines for now.
It’s too heated here.

00:54:44.651 --> 00:54:48.655
I’ll be okay in New York,
so I can get away from Alys.

00:54:51.423 --> 00:54:56.037
I didn’t tell you, Drake,
but I’m serious about Alys.

00:55:06.881 --> 00:55:08.579
I’m rooting for the both of you.

00:55:09.759 --> 00:55:12.011
I hope you and Alys
will be happy.

00:55:13.179 --> 00:55:14.259
Forever.

00:55:18.142 --> 00:55:19.259
Goodbye, Drake.

00:55:21.646 --> 00:55:22.790
Go.

00:55:22.939 --> 00:55:23.998
Go now.

00:55:24.023 --> 00:55:25.032
Go.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:33.775
Goodbye.

00:55:35.535 --> 00:55:36.579
Goodbye.

00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:40.782
Mom...

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:45.420
After you left, I felt so lonely.

00:55:46.129 --> 00:55:47.588
But then Alys came.

00:55:48.076 --> 00:55:49.150
Drake Palma!

00:55:50.204 --> 00:55:51.426
You’re my boyfriend now!

00:55:51.426 --> 00:55:52.719
Okay, bye!

00:55:53.845 --> 00:55:55.032
She’s a weirdo...

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.681
like me.

00:55:57.307 --> 00:55:59.183
Keep dreaming. You’re ugly.

00:55:59.642 --> 00:56:01.165
She sees through me.

00:56:01.477 --> 00:56:04.897
I know behind
that tough exterior,

00:56:05.606 --> 00:56:08.084
there’s a lot of angst in him.

00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:10.278
I see it in his eyes.

00:56:10.903 --> 00:56:13.172
She’s the only person
who understands me.

00:56:13.197 --> 00:56:14.365
Bestie, time to go home!

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.236
Makes me laugh.

00:56:17.618 --> 00:56:18.939
Bird brain!

00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:21.361
You’re rude!

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.298
And stays despite my hang-ups.

00:56:25.556 --> 00:56:28.923
Stand there until you remember.

00:56:30.423 --> 00:56:31.462
Huh?

00:56:32.091 --> 00:56:33.173
Drake!

00:56:33.509 --> 00:56:34.579
Drake!

00:56:35.011 --> 00:56:37.180
1131.

00:56:44.312 --> 00:56:46.368
But, she loves Sheen.

00:56:47.023 --> 00:56:47.957
I was hurt.

00:56:47.982 --> 00:56:49.917
Can I talk to you
after dismissal?

00:56:49.942 --> 00:56:52.754
Alys, Dad wants to see you.

00:56:52.779 --> 00:56:54.155
I’ll see you after dismissal.

00:56:55.831 --> 00:56:56.841
Drake!

00:56:56.866 --> 00:57:00.087
For the first time,
I felt really jealous.

00:57:00.127 --> 00:57:01.295
Let go of me!

00:57:02.121 --> 00:57:04.322
Next time,
when I give you something,

00:57:04.749 --> 00:57:06.476
don’t give it to someone else!

00:57:06.501 --> 00:57:07.477
Why Sheen?

00:57:07.502 --> 00:57:08.728
Are you two on a date?

00:57:09.921 --> 00:57:10.813
Yes.

00:57:10.838 --> 00:57:11.981
Why not me?

00:57:12.006 --> 00:57:14.759
I’m not lying, I already
had my first kiss!

00:57:15.259 --> 00:57:16.368
With who?

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.695
With Sheen!

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:20.973
From that moment, I
realized that I like her.

00:57:22.683 --> 00:57:25.923
I know Alys loves
me and I love her, too.

00:57:26.604 --> 00:57:28.439
But I feel like I’m difficult to love.

00:57:44.122 --> 00:57:48.000
I know you cried more than
five times because of me.

00:57:48.405 --> 00:57:49.656
I’m also hurting.

00:57:52.286 --> 00:57:54.032
I’m sorry for making you cry.

00:57:54.619 --> 00:57:57.892
Maybe there are more tears
to shed in the future.

00:57:58.803 --> 00:58:00.638
So this I say,
I’m sorry.

00:58:02.783 --> 00:58:04.118
But this is me.

00:58:12.233 --> 00:58:13.322
Alys?

00:58:15.278 --> 00:58:16.306
Alys?

00:58:18.406 --> 00:58:19.657
What if Alys leaves me?

00:58:21.159 --> 00:58:22.827
I don’t know if I can handle it.

00:58:29.237 --> 00:58:30.290
Where are you?

00:58:33.546 --> 00:58:34.822
Then Shaira came back.

00:58:35.673 --> 00:58:36.732
Hi, Drake!

00:58:36.757 --> 00:58:37.758
Mind if I join you?

00:58:39.302 --> 00:58:40.511
I’m so excited!

00:58:40.511 --> 00:58:41.571
Let's go!

00:58:41.596 --> 00:58:43.448
I know she is hurt.

00:58:43.656 --> 00:58:45.616
Why did you leave Shaira?

00:58:45.641 --> 00:58:47.577
I can handle her
being mad at me,

00:58:47.602 --> 00:58:49.270
I can’t handle you
not talking to me.

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:52.751
Are you sure this is safe?

00:58:52.953 --> 00:58:55.197
Tripp also came into the picture.

00:58:55.234 --> 00:58:56.461
Why are you with him?

00:58:56.486 --> 00:58:58.946
Are you accusing me
of cheating on you?

00:58:58.946 --> 00:59:00.381
Why, aren’t you?

00:59:00.406 --> 00:59:02.407
Every time I saw them together…

00:59:02.658 --> 00:59:03.861
I’m going to court Alys.

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.329
…it felt like hell inside me.

00:59:06.704 --> 00:59:07.847
You like her?

00:59:07.872 --> 00:59:10.541
Good luck.
She likes breaking hearts.

00:59:11.735 --> 00:59:13.445
I don’t want to lose Alys.

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:15.671
She’s only mine.

00:59:17.131 --> 00:59:20.697
Alys Zyril Perez,
soon to be Palma.

00:59:20.903 --> 00:59:22.259
Right, boyfriend?

00:59:23.095 --> 00:59:26.618
Because you always hurt
my feelings. Right, girlfriend?

00:59:26.939 --> 00:59:29.227
I really love Alys.

00:59:30.144 --> 00:59:31.228
I should kiss you.

00:59:31.812 --> 00:59:34.118
I will fight for Alys until the end.

00:59:34.478 --> 00:59:36.901
Once we start college,
we’ll go our separate ways.

00:59:37.652 --> 00:59:39.704
Who says that I’m
gonna break up with you?

00:59:40.321 --> 00:59:44.133
Alys, please be strong,
because I’m not.

00:59:44.158 --> 00:59:46.220
I don’t like it when
you speak profoundly.

00:59:47.662 --> 00:59:48.329
So annoying!

00:59:48.329 --> 00:59:50.873
I like you weird and shallow.

00:59:51.415 --> 00:59:53.543
So does that mean you like me?

00:59:53.793 --> 00:59:57.672
I’m weak, I’m broken,
and I need you.

00:59:58.422 --> 01:00:01.634
You’ll be my noob –
mine and mine only.

01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:06.430
I wish I could tell you
all of this, but I can’t.

01:00:07.306 --> 01:00:08.939
I hate explaining things.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.812
How am I supposed to
understand if you don’t explain?

01:00:13.104 --> 01:00:14.704
Because this is who I am.

01:00:15.481 --> 01:00:19.694
Breaking up is a mutual decision,
and I don’t wanna break up with you.

01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:23.470
But I know you love
me for who I am, Alys.

01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:26.407
So, I will try to change for you.

01:00:27.285 --> 01:00:29.822
It will be baby steps.

01:00:30.663 --> 01:00:34.907
But promise, I will try.
Because I love you, Alys.

01:00:37.169 --> 01:00:40.715
All I know is that I’ll do
everything even if it hurts me.

01:00:44.051 --> 01:00:48.055
Alys Zyril Perez,
I’m crazy for you.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:59.144
Is that her heartbeat or mine?

01:01:04.459 --> 01:01:05.618
My bird brain.

01:01:06.449 --> 01:01:07.462
My noob.

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:09.618
My seulement vous.

01:01:10.737 --> 01:01:11.790
I’m territorial.

01:01:34.769 --> 01:01:36.270
5:15 P.M.

01:01:41.025 --> 01:01:42.040
Alys.

01:01:44.607 --> 01:01:45.755
Drake.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.615
I’ve accepted your
relationship request.

01:01:47.616 --> 01:02:47.966
Support Admin Watch on Kisskh.Asia

01:01:48.991 --> 01:01:50.051
Huh?

01:01:50.303 --> 01:01:51.888
I talked to Shaira and Tripp.

01:01:53.148 --> 01:01:54.233
And we’re now free.

01:02:00.336 --> 01:02:01.384
Wait.

01:02:01.782 --> 01:02:03.409
Why are there
baggages in your unit?

01:02:08.135 --> 01:02:09.971
I’m sorry, I didn’t
tell you right away.

01:02:13.099 --> 01:02:16.185
I’m leaving for New
York in a few days, Drake.

01:02:19.021 --> 01:02:22.358
Can you handle having a
girlfriend a million miles away?

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.079
This is when things are
getting better,

01:02:30.366 --> 01:02:32.009
you’re choosing to leave now?

01:02:32.034 --> 01:02:33.636
And New York of all places, Alys?

01:02:33.661 --> 01:02:34.745
That’s so far.

01:02:37.025 --> 01:02:38.157
LDR?

01:02:38.416 --> 01:02:39.509
Can you handle it?

01:02:42.837 --> 01:02:45.172
I’ve gone from being a secret boyfriend

01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:47.758
to being a long distance boyfriend.

01:02:49.272 --> 01:02:50.407
Oh, well.

01:02:51.238 --> 01:02:53.103
My love life is so weird.

01:02:54.932 --> 01:02:57.451
Wow, so you know how
to joke now, huh.

01:02:57.476 --> 01:02:59.145
Even now, I miss you already.

01:03:00.604 --> 01:03:04.103
But you said you’d propose
when I turn 28, right?

01:03:04.859 --> 01:03:06.892
That’s still 10 years from now.

01:03:07.069 --> 01:03:09.155
I know. I’m already counting the days.

01:03:09.697 --> 01:03:12.408
I’m sure that you’re the one I
wanna spend my boring life with.

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:18.539
If I hadn’t made that promise
to Mom, I wouldn’t want to leave.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:22.626
I’m happy here in the Philippines.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.470
This one’s for you.

01:03:40.519 --> 01:03:41.520
Engagement ring.

01:03:44.523 --> 01:03:45.532
Plastic?

01:03:46.567 --> 01:03:47.710
Come on, Drake!

01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:49.487
Even if it’s plastic and
looks like it’s for kids,

01:03:49.528 --> 01:03:51.611
I worked hard to win it
from the arcade machine.

01:03:53.157 --> 01:03:58.704
That’s the proof that I’m willing
to be part of your boring life.

01:03:59.538 --> 01:04:00.751
Remember that, okay?

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:03.939
You’re weird, you know that?

01:04:07.755 --> 01:04:09.607
I accept your proposal, Alys.

01:04:09.632 --> 01:04:11.692
But since you’ll be flying soon,

01:04:11.717 --> 01:04:14.790
I’ll kiss you senseless, to
compensate for all the years.

01:04:16.138 --> 01:04:17.243
- What?
- Sshh!

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:23.062
Drake will kiss you,
but don’t tell your dads.

01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:24.665
They’re gonna kill me.

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:46.572
You were just a dare
at first, Drake Palma.

01:04:47.419 --> 01:04:48.462
Just a challenge.

01:04:49.755 --> 01:04:53.425
But what we went through challenged
me beyond what I could imagine.

01:04:54.218 --> 01:04:56.053
I don’t know how
I fell in love with you.

01:04:57.429 --> 01:04:59.431
But maybe that’s how love is.

01:05:00.057 --> 01:05:03.978
It can’t be explained
– you just feel it.

01:05:17.074 --> 01:05:21.845
I can’t explain why I deeply
love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:23.914
It’s too deep,

01:05:23.914 --> 01:05:28.252
to the point that I can’t contain
how my crazy heart beats for you.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:33.329
You’re the only person who
made me realize that love waits,

01:05:34.174 --> 01:05:36.844
love understands, and
most of all –

01:05:37.304 --> 01:05:38.806
love forgives.

01:05:48.478 --> 01:05:49.896
[In French] Only you.

01:05:52.654 --> 01:05:54.595
I love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

01:05:55.404 --> 01:05:59.743
I love you so much too,
Drake Sebastian Palma.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.001
Action!

01:06:41.867 --> 01:06:43.181
I learned from the best.

01:06:48.582 --> 01:06:49.625
Hey.

01:08:18.047 --> 01:08:19.214
My child!

01:08:19.673 --> 01:08:21.300
You’re talking too much!

01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:23.927
That hurts!

01:08:31.727 --> 01:08:32.978
Centipede!

01:09:59.356 --> 01:10:03.485
It’s a wrap for SDP Season 1!

01:10:04.611 --> 01:10:08.699
SDP, it’s a wrap!

01:10:21.194 --> 01:10:22.528
1...2...

01:10:23.528 --> 01:10:24.988
[In French] Only you.

01:10:28.218 --> 01:10:30.063
I love you, Alys Zyril Perez.

01:10:30.907 --> 01:10:34.243
I love you so much,
Drake Sebastian Palma.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:39.479
2...3...4...5...
