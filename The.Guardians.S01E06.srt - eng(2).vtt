[The Guardians]

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.920
[Episode 6]

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.380
This is...

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.540
The lady of our family.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.820
She said,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.260
she won't rest until the war is won.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.740
She wants to see our land restored.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.900
That's why Young Master fights so hard.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.100
Uncle Gu, how did she pass away?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.100
Miss Bingqing died because

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.100
she always led by example.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.100
Uncle Gu,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.260
weren't you the shipyard foreman?

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.380
How do you know so much
about the Gu family?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.380
I used to be Commander Gu's guard.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.260
Back in 1932, I was in Zhabei.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.260
I got hurt then,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.820
and the wound still hasn't healed.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.660
Commander Gu felt sorry for me,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.540
so he found me a job at the shipyard.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.980
I really shouldn't get involved

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.380
in your matters.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.410
I know, I get it.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.660
When things fall apart,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.130
no one gets out untouched.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.540
Good, as long as you understand.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.380
So, what happened now?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.660
Why did you take so long?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.660
Uncle Gu,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.940
can you drop me at the theatre first?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.980
Stop pretending with me.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.820
The theatre landlord told me everything.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.900
Some handsome, wealthy guy

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.140
bought the property for you.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.850
And just by chance,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.780
it happened right before my show.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.340
Tell me,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.780
if not for you, then why else?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.460
Couldn't it just be

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.900
my charming assistant?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.780
You?

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.700
How could a tiny troupe afford this?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.980
Just look around this place.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.460
Is anything here even worth much?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.980
I walked in all the way here.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.580
I thought I was at a smelly market.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.580
Let's not cause trouble, just leave.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.780
You're getting older,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.370
while I'm still young and shining,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.370
so you worry I'll steal your spotlight.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.140
That's why you chase after men so hard.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.780
Just thinking about it feels filthy.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.250
Sounds like your mind is so filthy.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.340
You have no shame at all!

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.140
Such dull insults, nothing new.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.660
You're just nasty!

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.220
Say that again!

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.580
I'm warning you, Xian Biyun,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.220
you won't chase me out that easily.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.020
There's more than one theatre
in Shanghai.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.940
Let me make myself clear today.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.180
This isn't over yet.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.820
Stop!

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.850
If you find a new employer, tell me.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.820
I need to send you the bill

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.740
for all the stuff you broke.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.180
Let's see how this goes.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.620
You head in first.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.700
I'll turn around and wait here.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.820
You're nobody.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.290
Why did you come back?

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.500
Did anyone see you outside?

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.210
No one did.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.620
At least, I think not.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.180
Why the sudden return?

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.500
Tonight, Takeda's hosting Joseph Lee.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.180
Gu Yangshan asked me to attend.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.260
But I need a favor.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.620
I was hoping you could help.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.940
Takeda nearly ended you last night.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.290
You're totally freaked out.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.850
Why would you still go see him?

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.740
Honestly, it's not that scary.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.620
Come over here.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.280
Sit.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:33.980
Here?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.340
Doesn't matter where I sit.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.220
Take off your glasses.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.490
Did Gu Yangshan make you do this?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:50.460
No, he didn't force me.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:51.700
Alright.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.580
Tell me the truth.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.580
What's your plan?

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.780
Ms. Xian, I really can't tell you.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.020
Last time, because of me,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.370
the whole troupe was in chaos.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.220
Even the Japanese showed up.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.020
So this time,

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.370
I can't drag you in again.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.220
Things are really urgent now.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.900
If you don't talk, how can I help?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.340
Here's the thing.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.020
Gu Yangshan asked me to tell Takeda

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.460
that Joseph Lee's cipher
has been leaked.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.700
If Takeda doesn't believe it,

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.140
I should suggest
he send a fake air raid telegram.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:22.580
Gu Yangshan will have the army

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.580
sound the air raid alarm.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.810
Once the alarm goes off,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.580
Takeda will be convinced

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.020
that Joseph Lee's cipher
has been leaked.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.220
Then the Japanese will stop using it.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.460
This is another risky plan.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.490
You could get exposed
in front of Takeda.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.220
That's why I want you to help me out.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.060
Ask Long Er to get me
a life-saving token.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.700
I remember,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.100
[Two months ago]
When I first acted for Joseph Lee,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.460
there was this one time,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.580
Mr. Takeda wanted to visit him.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.460
Step left, tap right.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.700
Step right, tap left.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.460
I'll cross-step.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.100
Oh,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.820
if the Japanese come here,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.220
should I make them tea,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.940
or cut some fruit?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.580
I can't see anything.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.370
You don't have to do a thing.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.530
Just put this photo

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.650
where everyone can see it.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.940
This looks just like me as a kid.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.060
Who's in the picture?

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.370
I have no idea.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.650
Takeda didn't show up that day.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.770
But I remember clearly,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.300
Joseph Lee once told me

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.890
that as long as the photo stays,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.060
the Japanese won't bother him.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.300
This is a serious matter.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.420
Just having Long Er on board

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.370
isn't enough.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.300
Are you looking for Cao Yuanzhong?

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.180
No, I'm here for you.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.770
Biyun.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:40.650
You mean,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:41.420
tonight,

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.180
Long Er's joining us too?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.690
Ding Yi wants Long Er's help

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.100
to steal a photo
from Joseph Lee's locker.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.340
It could save him at a critical moment.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:54.810
But if we do this,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.460
won't Long Er get dragged in too deep?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.810
Long Er and Zhao Fu are both eager.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.050
They should get a chance to grow,

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.050
just like Hongyu.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.690
When this is over,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.220
we can apply to the Party Organization.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.340
But

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.460
that's not the main issue here.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.100
We can't reach Cao Yuanzhong now.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.980
He tricked all of us.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.100
He never planned to act from the start.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.290
Too bad I don't have access,

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:29.050
so I can't use
the Shanghai Bureau's radio.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.340
Since you already know,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.570
what do you plan to do next?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.220
That's why I came to you.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.220
Luo Han, I know you have a radio

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.220
for secret talks with Chongqing.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.810
So if we use your radio,

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.980
plus the cipher
from the Shanghai Bureau,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.570
we can reach the 405th Battalion.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.930
Then this could work.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.460
Are you planning to make fake orders?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.570
If we get caught,

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:53.690
we're both done for.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.220
Luo Han, it's all or nothing now.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:59.980
Don't you get it yet?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.930
Why won't Cao Yuanzhong work with you?

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.570
It's because your plan is too risky.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.930
There's just no certainty in it.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:10.570
As agents,

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.220
we can't just count on luck.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.100
Then what should we rely on?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.570
What can we count on now?

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.100
Waiting for the Japanese to surrender?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.570
We can't afford to wait any longer.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.570
The soldiers may die,

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:22.340
so will the people.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.340
You...

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.810
Why won't you ever listen?

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.340
Don't be so idealistic.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:30.170
You can't drag others into your gamble.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.100
Do you know

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.460
how many lives are at stake?

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.690
We both know how the BIS works.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.170
Their system is tangled inside.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.620
They hardly get things done.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.500
Gu Yangshan just returned.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.570
He has no idea what he's dealing with.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.340
I'm honestly worried

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.570
he really doesn't have a way

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:50.740
to actually convince the 405th Battalion

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.340
to sound the air raid siren.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.690
But right now, this is the only way

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.940
to make the MSS pull back

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.330
Joseph Lee's cipher.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.700
It's our one shot.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.980
Since the BIS decided,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.460
they're already set on this path.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.340
There's no turning back.

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.050
We really should help him out.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.460
Do you know why he won't cooperate?

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.980
He's just looking out for himself.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.690
He wants to keep his hands clean.

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.570
But fighting for our country

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.170
takes real courage, not a cold heart.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.100
You all can stand by and watch,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.460
but I have to step up.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.460
For the country and revolution,
I'd give all.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.170
But it has to be on the battlefield.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.810
I'm not going to die with that guy.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.980
The front line is a battlefield,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.810
but so is the cipher system.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:35.500
And that guy you're talking about

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.340
is fighting for our mission right now,

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.810
all alone on his own!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.740
Is the BIS

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.740
going to hide and do nothing now?

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.930
I went back to visit him this morning.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.340
He cried and told me,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.220
he misses his mom.

00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:57.220
I couldn't even comfort him.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.690
I had to be even tougher

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.460
and made him help us with the cipher.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.170
I joined the BIS

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.100
to resist the invaders,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.980
to protect our people.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:04.810
And

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.460
he is one of them.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.500
But now, he's the one charging ahead.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.220
Why does it have to be him?

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.810
Who are we even fighting for?

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.460
Why do you trust this guy so much?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.570
Even a trained agent

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.620
might not pull off this job.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.220
You really believe

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.220
Ding Yi can convince Takeda?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.100
Honestly, I didn't at first.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.050
I was betting more than believing.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.220
But after I saw him

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.220
almost lost his life twice

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.220
because of our mission,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.340
Luo Han,

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.220
he means just as much to me

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:46.340
as you do now.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.690
He's my teammate too.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.170
If we don't trust our team,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.690
who else can we trust?

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.570
I'm out of time.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.220
Whether you help me today or not,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.570
I'll keep Ding Yi safe no matter what.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:14.690
Wait a second.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.810
There's one last option.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:27.460
Go on.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.050
We can't really count on the BIS.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.410
We should reach out to
the Party Organization.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:35.100
If Ding Yi and Gu Yangshan

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.570
get Takeda to send the telegram,

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.290
then the Party Organization

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.570
can contact the nearby base area

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:40.810
and set off the air raid siren too.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.220
That way, it'll also work.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.460
Sounds good. It's a safer plan.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.100
So,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.100
let's split up and handle this.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.740
You let Xiao know,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.500
and I'll take care of things here.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:15:59.620
Alright.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.460
From this moment on,

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.100
you're a staff member
of Metropolitan Hotel.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.170
Use the key Ding Yi gave you,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.980
go into Room 424, Joseph Lee's room.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.500
According to the plan,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.690
Takeda should arrive by six.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.570
So, to help Long Er get the photos,

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.220
let's buy some time.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.380
We have to slow Takeda down

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.570
on his way.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.170
Sir, what's going on up there?

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:46.810
But with just Zhao Fu,

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.340
we can't stall Takeda for long.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.570
At best, Long Er gets

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:52.620
an extra half hour.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.860
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.620
What are they doing up there?

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.620
So you have to move fast.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.050
No mistakes along the way.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.370
Ding Yi, are you serious?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.900
Mr. Lee, this way please.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.530
Room service.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:43.770
After Long Er succeeds,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.500
he'll find a way to hand you the photos

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.770
in the Normandy Private Room

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.370
before Takeda arrives.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.610
Mr. Takeda is on his way.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.770
Sir, do you need cleaning?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.740
Ms. Xian, wish me luck.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.020
It's no big deal.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.690
Let's start with one...

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:58.060
Two five, two six, two seven.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.160
[Normandy Private Room]

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.700
Long Er.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.900
If there are Japanese at the door,

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.020
don't just walk in.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.500
They might search you.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:36.370
Mr. Takeda.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.180
Mr. Lee.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.700
Mr. Lee.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.220
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.020
Mr. Takeda,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.420
you finally made it.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.740
Please, have a seat.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.660
You can hide the photos in the restroom.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.530
Then find a chance to pour Ding Yi wine.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.220
Use our special wine label

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.020
to pass the word to Ding Yi.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.330
Ding Yi.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.050
The exact spot of the photo

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.180
is written on the back
of the wine label.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:38.000
[Ladies Room]

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.330
Hey.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.240
[Ladies Room]

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.610
Mr. Lee, where's Charlie?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.660
He went to handle something for me.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.570
I'm sorry for what's happened recently.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.980
On behalf of the MSS, I apologize.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.610
Mr. Lee, what do you like to eat?

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:18.570
I ordered a few dishes for you.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.570
This is the restaurant's signature dish.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.700
Go ahead, give it a try.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.900
Mr. Takeda, you're really thoughtful.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.850
Honestly,

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.810
I've always been pretty proud.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.050
I never deal with anyone

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:35.610
outside the mathematics community.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.460
Even within the community,

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.420
if without real contributions,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.810
they're just nobody to me.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:46.980
But there's one exception,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.370
and that's you,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:50.330
Mr. Takeda.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.530
Since I came back to China,

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.810
you're

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.180
the first real friend I've made.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.290
You went out of your way

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.940
to help me connect with a top physician

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.130
to treat my eyes.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.460
But more than that,

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.700
from you,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.020
I feel a real respect
for mathematicians.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.850
Thank you.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.180
Bring the drinks.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.180
Yes.

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.370
The drink.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:38.900
Wait a sec.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.290
You go in

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.180
and leave the trolley here.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.900
I... I...

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.980
Mr. Takeda prefers sake.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.330
Mr. Takeda prefers sake.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.290
Sir,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.420
Mr. Lee enjoys red wine.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.620
Hey!

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.660
Move aside.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.580
Silly kid.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:23.750
Sorry, sorry.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.470
I'll do it myself.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.470
Serve our honored guests first.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.030
Sir,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.470
I won't let this fool

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.900
show up in front of you again.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.380
Get lost.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.950
Sorry, sorry about that.

Mr. Lee.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.180
The MSS has a gift for you.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.860
Just a small token of respect.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:47.380
Mr. Takeda,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:49.990
there's a saying in China,

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.340
once we meet, we're brothers.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.340
Blood ties aren't what matter.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.790
Exactly.

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:00.270
Mr. Takeda,

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.380
now you and I

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.180
are brothers.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:05.510
Brothers.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.270
Between brothers, money doesn't count.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.660
It's all about trust.

00:25:12.050 --> 00:25:12.510
Come on.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.860
Here's our first drink tonight.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.140
To our friendship.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.140
Alright.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.100
Cheers.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.860
Cheers.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.900
Since money's off the table,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.750
let's talk about

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.380
women, okay?

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:56.900
Hurry up, come on.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.140
Hurry.

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:06.100
Everyone, have a seat.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:07.660
Have a seat.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.510
Thanks for helping me out earlier.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.860
Have we met before?

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:30.470
Mr. Lee, please.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:38.230
You're Ding Yi's driver.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.950
Joseph Lee, you're his driver.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.900
I'm here to help Ding Yi.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:48.790
He didn't mention

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:49.950
there'd be outsiders tonight.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.340
Looks like this job is pretty big.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:55.030
I don't have time to explain.

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:56.990
You can trust me on this.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.710
Are you bringing something in?

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.990
I wrote on the back of the wine label.

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:05.790
The ink I used is special.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.230
It only shows up for three minutes.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.420
After three minutes,

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.270
even if Takeda tears off the label,

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:11.710
he still won't find anything.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.380
But I accidentally left Ding Yi's photo

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.660
under a flowerpot in the ladies' room.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:23.030
Mr. Lee, these two women

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.710
are friends visiting from Japan.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.660
And on your left

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.420
is a top actress from Shanghai,

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.030
Miss Chunlan.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:36.990
Mr. Joseph Lee

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.620
is my business partner.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:42.380
That's not right.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.790
He's my brother now.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:48.470
It's you.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.140
You bumped into me this afternoon.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.100
You two know each other?

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.380
Yeah.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.580
We met at Chaosheng Theatre earlier.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.900
Right?

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.580
Sorry about that, miss.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:14.180
I can't see well.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:16.860
My apologies.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:18.270
Mr. Lee.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.900
Why were you at Chaosheng Theatre?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.420
Had some personal business.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.380
Personal business?

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.380
Didn't expect you had interests

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.990
besides math, Mr. Lee.

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.070
Just

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.660
went to find someone.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.580
Who's that important to deserve

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.470
your personal visit?

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.580
What does Chaosheng Troupe even have,

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:00.470
besides Xian Biyun?

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:04.710
Mr. Lee,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.900
don't tell me you're there for her.

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.710
Even a blind guy isn't spared.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.710
She really isn't picky at all.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:25.790
Mr. Lee,

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.420
do you know Ms. Xian?

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:32.790
How did you two even meet?

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.100
Yes, Mr. Lee.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.180
Come on, tell us the story.

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:42.620
It's a secret.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.620
I can't stand guys who only say half.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.710
Thinking of Ms. Xian,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.580
she once was a big star in Shanghai.

00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:54.030
But now... well.

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.270
Mr. Lee, see?

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.420
Mr. Takeda and I are both curious.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.710
Why not just tell us?

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.660
Ms. Xian is truly stunning.

00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.420
A story of a gifted man
and a lovely woman.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.030
I'm all ears.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.380
Alright.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.340
A woman who can truly own

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.140
Soir de Paris.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.100
The moment I met her,

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.180
for the first time ever,

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.790
I wished my eyesight were better.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.710
Kid, you even tried to scam Mr. Ma.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:57.790
If you dare do it again,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.510
you're really done for!

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.100
Let's go.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:02.950
Yes.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:03.660
Yes.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.180
The first time I met Ms. Xian,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.270
we were right outside

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.580
the Chaosheng Theatre.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.270
It was

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:22.790
pouring rain.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.990
I slipped

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.790
and fell.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.380
Mr. Lee, I didn't expect you

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:37.580
and Ms. Xian

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.900
to have that kind of connection.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:40.950
I'm flattered.

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.270
So that night,

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.230
did you rush to Chaosheng Theatre

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.510
just to meet

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.180
Ms. Xian?

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.580
Which night?

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.030
Oh, I remember now.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:31:57.950
That day,

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.100
after I parted ways with you,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.180
I went straight to William's Residence.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.510
I just passed by the theatre on the way.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.470
Hold on, Mr. Takeda,

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.140
how did you know about this?

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.030
Don't tell me,

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:18.470
you were following me?

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.470
Ask Ms. Xian to come over.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:31.950
Yes.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.510
Mr. Lee.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:37.950
Tonight.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:42.030
You'll get an even bigger surprise soon.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:50.420
Thank you.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.140
My pleasure, ma'am.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:01.380
God created Eve,

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.030
what a genius move.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.180
Interesting.

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.380
Such a lively crowd.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.030
Please, have a seat.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.950
Is that Ms. Xian?

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.140
Mr. Lee,

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:32.180
the big surprise I mentioned is here.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.660
I know you like Ms. Xian,

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.420
so as your brother,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.380
I took the liberty of inviting her.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.790
I hope you don't mind

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.660
if I'm being too forward.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.340
What if I said I do?

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.140
Can you bring Ms. Xian back now?

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.990
Just joking around.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.700
It was only a joke.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:15.740
You were talking behind my back.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.580
What were you saying about me?

00:34:18.490 --> 00:34:20.700
I heard about your little romance.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.700
It's really just my own story.

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.580
Just how I feel, that's all.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.350
It has nothing to do

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.580
with Ms. Xian.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.910
But I'm kind of

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:36.260
curious.

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:41.030
Ms. Xian, do you still remember

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.390
how Mr. Lee and you

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:44.700
first met?

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.660
I saw him fall outside the theatre.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:21.990
So I just helped him up.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:26.070
And then what happened?

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.350
All I remember is

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.390
the first thing Ms. Xian said was...

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:02.950
"Are you blind or what?"

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:08.550
Looks like

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.780
this romance

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:13.030
doesn't just belong to Mr. Lee.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.660
It's about both of you.

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:28.510
Honestly, I

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.670
really don't like hearing

00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.620
the word blind.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.620
But somehow,

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.870
when Ms. Xian said it,

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.780
it felt gentle to me.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.470
I never felt judged.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.700
Even now, I remember that night,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.220
Ms. Xian sheltered me from the rain,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:49.700
then let me ride in her car,

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.030
and even dropped me at the hotel.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.470
All along the way,

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.220
from Ms. Xian herself,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.100
I caught the scent of Soir de Paris.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.910
And for a moment, I felt

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.580
just like being in Paris.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.660
Amazing.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.390
Amazing.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:17.550
Mr. Lee.

00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:23.260
Let's toast to your love.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.870
Excuse me, who's having red wine?

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.430
I'll have a glass.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:37:59.700
Mr. Lee, your memory's sharp.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.260
No dancing for me, just wine.

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:10.220
I just want wine.

00:39:05.570 --> 00:39:06.300
Excuse me for a moment.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:56.070
Gu Yangshan.

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.220
405th Battalion will sound the siren.

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.740
But if you fail, can you handle

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.260
the risk of faking intel

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.390
with the Shanghai Bureau's cipher?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.180
We'll make it, no doubt.

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.950
Eight o'clock. I promise you.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.620
I give you my word.

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.780
That air raid siren will go up.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.550
Ms. Xian

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.470
knows a lot about UK culture.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:53.910
But it's a shame,

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:54.870
so far,

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.830
she's never been to the UK.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.780
So I was thinking,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.950
if one day,

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.220
I could travel with her

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.830
and visit London together,

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.430
that would be an amazing trip.

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:11.740
Mr. Lee, you have to keep your word.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:13.660
Of course.

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.260
Well,

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.070
to thank Mr. Lee for the trip,

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.430
let's have another toast.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.140
To Ms. Xian.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:36.780
Mr. Takeda.

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:38.870
Thank you.

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:41.740
What's wrong?

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.100
Colonel Sasaki has returned to Shanghai.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.870
There's an urgent meeting now.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.550
They want you there.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.390
Got it.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:56.030
Mr. Lee,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:58.830
I have some work

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:00.390
that needs my attention.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.300
Shall we

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.550
call it a night?

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.580
I'll head to the Normandy Private Room.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.700
Don't get to the topic

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.660
until I show up.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:13.830
Mr. Takeda,

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.580
you're the one who invited me today,

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.140
and now you're leaving first?

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.550
But I'm not ready

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:23.910
to stop drinking.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.780
Ms. Xian and Miss Chunlan are here.

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.950
So enjoy yourself, Mr. Lee.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.580
Keep him company.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:39.260
Mr. Takeda,

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.430
don't rush off yet.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.180
Come here.

00:42:41.850 --> 00:42:42.780
Let me share a drink with you.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.430
Mr. Takeda. Mr. Kobayashi.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:51.430
Mr. Lee.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.830
I've got the ship ticket
to China Hong Kong

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:54.620
for tomorrow night.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:57.030
There were too many people buying.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:58.350
Sorry for being late.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:42:59.480
It's okay.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.700
Mr. Lee, you're leaving?
